The genesis of this page was as the cobbled together embarrassment of an article List of Charmed episodes as it was constituted around the new year of 2009.

Subsequently, the list of episodes was split out into four seasons pages, and concurrently work began transforming that page into a page with a table of articles, without the synopses, which will be handled by pages like this one.

"""==Passion Killing in Namibia==
Introduction

In the Cambridge Advance Learner’s Dictionary, passion is defined as a very powerful feeling, for example of sexual attraction, love, hate, anger or other emotions and killing is defined as the act of murder. In this context Passion Killing is combined.Passion Killing can be defined as the act of killing someone out of the feeling of extreme anger, love, hate or other emotions.

In the past passion killing in Namibia was very minimal but now the number has gone up and it has become a trend. Recently, a large number of continuous Passion killing cases have been reported. So far it is only men that have been reported to have murdered women, breakups and infidelities being 2 of the main reasons amongst many.In this article I’m going to contemplate and discuss the causes of this aggravated passion killing in our society, who is at fault and recommendations as to what can be done to stop this type of violence.

The causes
The question on everyone’s lips is, “why are men killing women?”

 Amongst many causes, the most popular causes of passion killing reported have usually followed from women who depend on men for financial support, for things such as accommodation, tuition fees in a case of a student, food, clothes and other essential basic needs and in this case, men tend to become possessive and feel they own the women and when women call it quits, the men usually feels betrayed and sour and end up killing the women.The Namibian, 2012Namibian

 Another major cause that leads to Passion killing in our society is infidelity from women. When a woman cheats and the men finds out, the feeling of betrayal usually overpowers the man and they end up killing.

 A possible cause could be the lack of self control and lack of respect towards women.Causes

Who is at fault?
As I have observed, both men and women are to be blamed in different cases.

Firstly, certain men are at fault are because they don’t seem to understand the real meaning of love. """"The country should cry out for help. True love is patient, love is kind - it does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. Love always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres.. Bishop Kleopas Dumeni, 2012 

Even if love is not involved, as it is in some cases, one would often feel that their ego is bruised or that their money has gone down the drain because they felt they had invested in something that they can own as property.In other cases men tend to become desperate for love and affection and end up offering material things and money to women to get some sort of affection even though the women have not demanded for it, In the end they feel they own the women and when they cheat or end the relationship they result to killing. 

Women are at fault in cases such as when they do not work hard to be independent and they accept all this material things because they want a chance at a luxurious and easy life at little to no cost. But little do they know that they might up paying with their lives when they do not stick to the person who is supplying with them with this sort of life. 

Women or both men and women are also at fault because they enter or initiate relationships for the wrong reasons, be it for money or sex and soon and in the end the differences start to surface, then there are misunderstandings and pain to one or both parties. 
Either way there are many different cases regarding passion killing and in  different cases either sexes are at fault but this still does not justify passion killing.

Recommendations
Recommendations 
The solution to this problem is a hard one to solve because it would require some sort of reaching out to the people of this Nation. Knowing the diversity of people, it’s hard to figure out what would impact certain people.  Never –the –less, the nation cannot sit back and watch this type of evil carry on. Informante
A number of people have come up with reinforcing the death penalty. But I believe one cannot fix another evil with evil.""""So what is the exact answer to the problem, should we bring back the death penalty? Will it stop the passion killings?",0

"Double Standards & Issues -  

 

Dear “Lessheard vanU” and to Wikipedia including all editors and administrators & Mr. Wales:   This is a very serious issue.  We contributing writers have attempted to follow wikipedia written polices in contributing and adding to an existing article or creating one.  Yet there are double standards beings upheld by wikipedia’s own editors and administrators.  As with Blackpearl14, who clearly believes that wikipedias polices don’t apply to her, and with other editors who uphold double standards.   Then when challenged to the double standards, including Blackpearl14's violation of wikipedia’s own written polices and reckless authoritarian rule and control, other wikipedia editors and administrators then support each other when one of them continues to violate wikipedia’s own written polices.    “Lessheard vanU” had then wrongly and deliberately calls the contributing people who writes back and flags the issue at hand a “harassing the editor”, outright agreeing with Blackpearl14.  Then in addition to IP address being blocked, all “talk & discussion” are deleted  leaving only one sided bias and reckless claims against the contributing writers.  Even though wrongly deleted by wikipedia editors & administrators, all of this has been recorded, including that Blackpearl14 having repeatedly writing in both correspondence and her bio page (copies have been secure)  that the articles belong to her and they will continue to be own and controlled by her.  These statements alone proves that she is in violation of wikipedia’s own written polices and purpose.  Yet you have ignored that.

As previously written in discussion, per wikipedia’s own written polices, but immediately deleted by Blackpearl14 and then sanctioned by  “Lessheard vanU”, Blackpearll4 - calls herself evidently Mrs. Johnny Depp and Pirate lord-ess and such.  She celebrates on her official wikipedia bio pages that she did many pages and articles on the Walt Disney Company and Pirates of the Caribbean for wikipedia.   Why would someone devote so much time to 24/7 check the site and on these pages, and then recklessly calls anyone who doesn’t follow her bias views vandals, attackers and such.   Has her judgement become impaired?   Her goal to fuse her love and fantasies with the Walt Disney Company and Pirates of the Caribbean is very clear.  That is a conflict of interest and that is not being neutral and is against wikipedia’s own written polices.  Sorry, but if one purchases products, such as Pirates of the Caribbean posters, toys and Walt Disney merchandise and also using emotional love and fantasies for wikipedia / wikinews articles, doesn’t make the articles neutral and it causes a conflict of interest.   As recorded, Blackpearl14's pages regarding this issue are one sided, not neutral, are bias, in conflict of interest and are all promotional tools promoting the causes and products of the Walt Disney Company and Pirates of the Caribbean.   Yes, Pirates of the Caribbean and similar wikipedia articles are not neutral, they are a series of one sided promotional pages including links to products and causes of the Walt Disney Company.   Following wikipedia’s own written “neutral” policy, entire articles would have to be deleted.    Yet Blackpearl14 continues to violate Wikipedia polices and purpose.  

Then with IP’s being deliberately blocked and contributing writers having been wrongly accused and falsely called various things, if anyone then attempts to generate a new article related to Pirates of the Caribbean following wikipedia’s own written polices, editors and administrators gang up and generate false reason upon reason, to delete those articles and ban the IP user.   They use a countless list of double standards and twisted logic to justify their reckless acts.   It’s a total lock out by the editors and administrators, abusing their trust tools, acting like a private monarchy.   To date, Blackpearl14's has proven she has ultimate control, has repeatedly stated that is her purpose, and had even sought to have the articles locked.    Then you “Lessheard vanU” wrote that you don’t want to lock these articles, stating it goes against company policy, but yet you added that you are preparing to possibly lock the articles in some capacity and do other acts against those who have been falsely branded and wrongly labeled as “vandals” and “harassing the editors” etc...

Other editors and administrators who have proven their practice of bias and manipulative and outright double standards practices include “SVTCobra” and “Whoville” and “Chris Mann”.

We have documented that they enforce one set of wikipedia polices yet discard and ignore those same policies when it applies to themselves or their selective circle of peers.

Bigfoot

Welcome back. Like the Devil and Daniel Webster. True, the intro is a mess and it must be made clear that Bigfoot is not a proven zoological species, but is tentative, and unproven. But the search goes on for evidence. The extreme LENGTH of this search leads researchers, with or without PhDs, to speculate that there may be a""""Plan C"""" where the beings may be neither hoax, (too many sighitngs for that) nor zoological (no body) but instead may be a theoretical space-time creature. This has not yet been stated. It needs to be. Skeptical editors can relax and know that skeptics are correct, there is no zoological Bigfoot nor Yeti. But there is something else. This is being ignored and swept under the rug. Always remember that with no official funding, """"mainstream"""" science has no positive opinion on the topic, and the work goes on by unpaid PhDs and many amateurs, and one paid non-academic.

Now, we, the Six, on the BF Edit Committee in Berkeley, will edit and re edit, and revert 
until the end of time to get the true and correct word out to readers. We will NOT
go away. Editors would be well-advised to work with our suggestions, since we know the literature and most editors never cracked a book. They, except one or two, do not kow squat on the topic, and most are lost in the theoretical quagmire. Most, it seems, 
are also uneducated. Daniel, welcome back.

"I read an interesting essay once, entitled: The Pre-Med as a Metaphor of Antipathy. The author was (IIRC) a basic-science professor trying to understand why pre-meds were such jerks, and whether the qualities selected for by the pre-med process were necessarily the ones that would make for an exemplary physician. Taking the pre-med curriculum was among the most depressing experiences of my life - a relentlessly grinding, competitive exercise in rote memorization of material that held little interest or applicability for me. I felt bad for people who took organic chemistry and biology because they were actually interested in those subjects - they were trampled in a horde of people who had come from the top of their high school classes and were trying to beat the curve, inexorably normed to a C+/B-, to get into med school.I certainly witnessed a reasonable amount of cheating, and I'm sure there were more egregious things happening out of plain sight. I was amazed, when I took the MCATs, at the level of security and anti-cheating measures in place. They did basically everything except a retinal scan, but I suppose such things are necessary.

The third bullet point:
 even though part of the ruling nation within the British Empire, a tendency of many Scots to perceive themselves as victims of English colonialism and cultural imperialism within British institutions, such as the perceived marginalisation of coverage of Scottish affairs by the BBC.

My understanding of the cringe is that it is essentially a sense of inferiority or embarrassment at all things Scottish felt by some Scots themselves. Someone manifesting the Scottish cringe would therefore be unlikely to feel hard done by any marginalisation of coverage of Scottish affairs by the BBC.

"Muhammad's teacher
I know this is quite difficult to accept for you muslims, but, as it is, this guy was (one of several) Muhammad's teacher. This is an irrefutable fact of history. I realise that the idea of Muhammad having a teacher beside Allah is some kind of heresy for you, but, here's the truth: Muhammad had an Assyrian Christian teacher. Muhammad learned a lot from him. I am not misrepresenting any source by pointing out this well known fact amongst theologians. It may be so, that Sargis Bkheera did not teach Muhammad about everything, but Muhammad gleaned a lot from him.

Here's what AINA says:

633 A.D. (5383)
Muhammad declares himself the prophet of God and originates Islam. It is well known that Muhammad's principal teacher was the Assyrian monk Sargis Bkheera. This accounts for the extraordinary doctrinal similarity between some aspects of Islam and the Assyrian Church of the East. For example, according to Assyrian Church doctrine, there is no awareness of passage of time between the moment of death and final judgement; final judgement occurs immediately even though thousands of years may have passed on Earth. Islam holds this same view. It is also noteworthy that the Koran states that in the day of final judgement the angels of Allah will speak to man in Assyrian.http://www.aina.org/aol/peter/timeline.htm''

Where do you think Muhammad got that from? Of course, he got it from his Assyrian Christian teacher. You want this referenced from some academic work? I'm sure that's no problem. Here you go, take your pick:  He was Muhammad's teacher. Stop reverting unless you have some source refuting this claim.

You're not even Maltese, how do you expect to correctly edit a page about a person who's only notable in Malta?

 How about an RFC then? 

Can we try an RFC?  I'd like to start with a brief neutral statement of the question and have others here respond with one statement each, link prior discussions if you like, limited to 1000 words, no rebuttals or arguments, then wait for comments from others, at least two days before any reactions.  The neutral question would be """"Should the title of this article be Territory of the Military Commander in Serbia, or Serbia under German Occupation, or something else; consider the prior talk sections above.""""  I will not be making a statement myself, but I may respond after two days, or sooner if others decide not to respect the proposal.  OK?    
No. An RFC while there's an RM going on? Just list the RM on various noticeboards. And an RfC for what exactly? If someone wants to move the article - let him post an RM, that's what its for. We'd probably go through the whole annoying song and dance to no effect. And where's the sense in having an RM for a move to one title, while posting an RfC (of all things) for a move to another title??

I'm sure Antidiskriminator & Co. will jump at this, since for them whatever you (their perceived new-found ally )) propose and I oppose must be a good thing. But it makes no sense. I certainly won't accept any title that has not been agreed-upon in a proper RM, whatever the outcome of the RfC - indeed, if any. Additionally, an RfC may not be the most useful and effective means of DR here, since the dispute is immensely complex, obscure, and thoroughly bogged-down in misleading rhetorical nonsense.

Utter nonsense showing exactly what is wrong with Wikipedia

This article reads like a press release, and uncritically accepts the claim that the CL is a """"civil rights"""" organization whose primary purpose is fighting """"bigotry"""", when in fact they attack anyone who criticizes any aspect of Catholicism no matter how politely or correctly, they actively proselytize for Catholicism as the one true religion, and their leader William Donohue, who is for all practical purposes their only member, has made numerous anti-Jewish statements. It is also a lie to say that the CL is a lay organization not controlled by the Church, when in fact their office is located within the Archdiocese of New York's headquarters and they work closely with the Archbishop to coordinate media strategies.

The NPOV and anti-libel policy on Wikipedia has become an """"accept anything everyone says without blinking an eye and don't criticize anyone on relevant grounds"""" policy because none of the editors here actually know anything about the subjects of the articles. If someone who was not a fifteen-year-old anime-watching idiot could actually become an administrator around here, maybe we could see an article on the Catholic League actually discuss what the Catholic League is known for in American politics. Instead, we get nonsense criticism sections telling us things like what PETA thinks of Beyonce Knowles, while anything of actual relevance to the world today is declawed for fear of """"offending"""" people who don't like the truth or for being sued for libel due to a poor understanding of the law.

To answer you question. I put ticks to show how we can join the dots but can only do it through reliable sources if you are not sure is something is a reliable source you can always ask at WP:RSN (reliable sources noticeboard).

Perhaps an example of what you can do with your sources is the easiest way to go. In my sandboxes|sanbox]] I am many others developing an article on  one of the players in that was a man called Francis Windebank (Royalist soldier) as Wikpedia had no article on him, I created one based on the text in the Dictionary of National Biography for his father  see Wikisource:Windebank, Francis (DNB00). To do this I had to extract the article from an OCR version that is kept on Wikisource and put place it where it is now. So having put in the work to extract the article about his father I added said information to his more famous father's article Francis Windebank  With me so far? (BTW. We can copy copyright expired text strait into an article. The dos and don't are explained in the guideline WP:PLAGIARISM).
 
So when I expanded the Francis Windebank article it included the line """"Two others (daughters) became nuns of the Calvary at the Marais du Temple, Paris"""". Marais du Temple was a red-link, so I went on line and discovered that there was little in English on it but there was a French Wikipedia article so I copied and translated the lead from the French article and created Temple du Marais as a stub, unfortunately it still does not have citations, but from the pictures it clearly exists so it has not been put up for deletion. But in creating that article another red link was created Michel Villedo. So I created a stub for that. In that case it was much easier to source because there are reliable English language sources for the man.

So as you can see, one can use an article like minor campaigns of 1815 which has the potential to spark a whole level of creativity with missing biographies. It was your edit to the article that prompted me to look up detail on Charles Auguste Creutzer, and as I found enough I created the stub Charles Auguste Creutzer. But that still leave open the question """"how do you know that Siborne was referring to Charles Auguste Creutzer when he wrote General Kreutzer and not some other General Kreutzer? What is your source for saying he was the commandant of the Fortress of Bitsch?"""". As soon as a source can be found that say that we can modify the text or create an redirect

 Vandalism on B-theory of time 

It seems perhaps I have been going about this the wrong way, so I will try to be helpful and explain WHY your last edit was vandalism.

First off, the description intro, the quality of the intro had been greatly increased, Naming McTaggart as the founder is just repeating was is in the origin section, hence there is no need for it. The description gave a better just of what B-thoery of time is a whole. Undoing this completely is therefore vandalism, ESPECIALLY if you don'y first talk about it in the talk page before editing.

Secondly, you removed 'description', you then deleted the description as in metaphysics, changed the better, updated version of the physics part, then moved it in the origin section. There really is nothing I can say about this, I have no idea what kind of twisted reasoning could be behind that move?!....

Thirdly you removed this section: It is noted by Dean Zimmerman in 'Presentism and the Space-Time Manifold' that A-theory is 'almost certainly a minority view among philosophers', while B-theory has 'achieved broad acceptance'.http://fas-philosophy.rutgers.edu/zimmerman/Presentism%20and%20Rel.for.Web.2.pdf
It seems you perhaps have a personal agenda, favouring A-theory therefore editing in favour of it, this is not allowed on wikipedia, and it is vital to keep a Neutral point of view. The above statement however, is correct and cannot be removed simply because you do not want people to see it.

Finally, and on the most relevant side, you Craig information, it is an improvement that you have put the Craig talk in an oppose section as opposed to to the description section.
However a lot of it is not quoted, rather you have stated the opposition as out right fact. Such as...

""""The B-Theory suffers the same incoherence as all theories that time is illusory, namely, that an illusion or appearance of becoming involves becoming, so that becoming cannot be mere illusion or appearance. The Buddhist can consistently deny the reality of the physical world, since the illusion of physicality does not entail physicality, but this is not the case with temporal becoming."""" You stated this outright. This is an OPINION of Craig's it should be demonstrated as such, I also do not believe it belongs on the page and it is an obvious dig at another religion. 
In fact you have stated all of Craig's OPINIONS as fact.

If you want to make edits, please first discuss them in the talk page, and we can talk about whether it is relevant or not, and how it should be worded.

Also, is this policy worded in an appropriate way  if a banned user asks to have something included, does that really mean that all of the sudden everyone is forbidden from including it?

It was 89.57. You rounded up. I love how have to type sentence after sentence about a subject you clearly know nothing about. It was a 27.3 m (89.5 ft) female caught off the South Shetland Islands in January 1925. Whether it was measured or not I can't say. It wasn't measured by a scientist in the standard zoological manner (in a straight line from the tip of the rostrum to the notch of the flukes) though, so it probably wasn't measured accurately (if at all). It was most likely measured alongside a factory ship during flensing (unless it was taken to the Deception Island station). This was just before the widespread use of stern slipways, so it would have been difficult to measure if it indeed was. The cited source should be Mackintosh and Wheeler (1929), which cite Risting (1928), which I don't have access to. Mackintosh and Wheeler simply say it was """"27.3 m. or 89 ft. 6 in."""" (p. 321).

Well, in general, using examples from other articles will not be helpful, because there is a lack of consistency.  In fact, the article about Kodokan Judo is currently at Kodokan, and Itto-ryu is currently at Ittō-ryū.  Please be aware of the difference, though, between arts where the name of the martial art practiced (such as """"judo"""" or """"kenjutsu"""") is a part of the name of the school, and where it is just describing the school.  If it is part of the school's """"official"""" name, it should be capitalized, and be included in the name of the article.  If it is not part of the school's official name, it should not even be part of the article's title, much less capitalized. Thus, I believe (and I could be mistaken) that Kodokan should actually be moved to Kodokan Judo, while Ittō-ryū should stay where it is.  A good rule of thumb might be, if you were to go to Japan, and look at the sign hanging over the front door, what would it say.  I suppose Itto-ryu might included """"Kenjutsu"""" after it, but certainly any of the comprehensive koryu would have only the name of the school.  Daito-ryu, on the other hand, seems to clearly use """"Aikijujutsu"""" as part of its name.  There's even a great old photo of Morihei Ueshiba from the 1930s, sitting in seiza in front of a sword stand and a hanging banner that reads (in kanji, of course) """"Daito-ryu Aikijujutsu"""".

Regarding the hyphen in """"aiki-jujutsu"""", I may have actually been the one to add that originally.  It's purely a personal preference issue.  There are no rules regarding hyphens in Hepburn romanization, their use is up to the judgment of the writer to include them wherever they help to improve clarity.  I felt that an English-speaking reader with no Japanese experience might have a hard time with """"aikijujutsu"""", because all of the repetitive vowels kind of make the word blur together, and it is a logical place to break the word up, without making it look like two entirely separate words. Or putting it another way, it makes """"aikijujutsu"""" readily identifiable as a compound word, and clearly shows the two root words.  I am not at all attached to doing it this way, though, and would have no problem with them all being changed back to """"aikijujutsu"""", if anyone feels strongly about it.  """,0

 Kahan recentism 

I just reverted an edit by Vgy7ujm for two reasons. First, the relevant article was only published 4 days ago, and so it is too recent for the rest of the academic community to have chewed it over and responded in any way. The articles in Wikipedia are not random newsfeeds of the latest events in each topic, but are encyclopedic summaries based mainly on secondary sources, that give a balanced overview of their subject. Primary research sources published in the last few days rarely make an article, and should never be used at the end of a section implying that they may represent the 'last word' on a subtopic. Secondly, the abstract of the referenced paper actually says that, by setting experimental subjects """"“science comprehension” tests"""", that it has detected """"the contamination of the science-communication environment with forms of cultural status competition"""". This is a long way from the much more even-handed coverage that Vgy7ujm gave it, by saying """"that global warming skeptics are as familiar with the relevant science as their opponents. They simply arrive at different conclusions."""" - as if this gives their antiscience views equal validity.

 User:Ryulong and his use of rollback 

Dabomb, can you remove User:Ryulong's use of rollback? He knows what it's for, I'm certain (his ~6 years and +162,000 edits as a user would indicate such), but he used it to systematically revert edits to convert navboxes to WP:HLIST, which is the new agreed upon way to format navboxes.

He then decided, by himself without bothering to ask or confirm these changes are by consensus, that the hlist is """"a bad format"""" and changed that navbox back.

"""CCD affecting other insects?==
While all this is certainly entertaining, the qoute does not stand on its own in that even if all honeybee populations collapse, mankind will not disappear. Wild pollinator insects, animals, and even wind can still pollinate many even most edible food crops. Even if those crops that depend solely on domestic bee pollenation cannot be produced any longer, humans would adapt agriculture to fill those niches.  

At this point it's not clear yet that CCD only affects bees.  It certainly stands to reason that other insects could be affected by the same disorder.  Also, the quote may be overly simplified.  But the big picture is that without pollinators, things are much more difficult. 

I have not seen any references that have indicated that wild bee populations, wild pollinators or other insects have been affected by the same disorder. If you know of any references that cite a similar decline in native or wild pollinators it may be helpful to include a section on this. 
Wild bees are generally becoming rare in the Western world due to habitat destruction. This is AFAIK most severe in C Europe.  
I agree that wild bees are increasingly rare worldwide, but the cause has little if anything to do with colony collapse.  
""""Little if anything""""? The proper and correct response is it has nothing to do with CCD. Even in the event that CCD should prove to be a """"disease"""", diseases are rather specific in what they affect, and a disease that affects honey bees is unlikely to affect any other insects; and there are only 7 species of honey bees. It's like expecting that a disease that affects deer will spread to other mammals, such as humans. That is an unreasonable expectation - it most definitely does NOT """"stand to reason that other insects could be affected by the same disorder"""" - the reality is exactly the opposite. The seven species in the genus Apis have had something on the order of 35 million years of independent evolution - 35 million years for their genomes to diverge from those of all other insects; compare that to the 70 million years mammals have existed. The human genome has had about as much time to diverge from deer, as the honey bee genome has had to diverge from other bees. But no one expects humans and deer to be affected by the same diseases. Why should a honey bee disease affect other bees?
While it is certainly true that habitat destruction and climate change are major threats to pollinating insects, bees foremost among them, CCD, even in a worst-case scenario, is not a threat to anything outside of agriculture.

 Vandalism by 99.44.204.232. Please stop it  

Would 99.44.204.232 stop vandalising this article.  People have invested a lot of time and effort to improve this article  it doesn't help if you keep vandalising it.  In future if you have something positive to add to this article please discuss it in the talk page.  I have to spend hours undoing what you have just done.  Citing several sources (some of which are unreliable) about one particular issue which has already been addressed and sourced with notable sources is one thing, deleting edits with notable sources and then copying and pasting those sources to make a point is another.  You wanted the article to talk about Serer Nile Valley migration.  That had already been discussed several times with notable sources like Gravrand, Cheikh Anta Diop, etc.  You also wanted the ethnonym of Serer to reflect the thesis of Diop.  The article already did that with notable sources including Diop himself.  If only you took the time to read the whole article you would have realised that, all these had been addressed. However, you should also appreciate that not every scholar and certainly not the ultra traditionalist Serer who wants nothing to do with Egypt agree with Diop and in fact his thesis were rebutted by several scholars including Schuh, etc.  These are relevant view points which should also be taken into account in other to avoid bias.  

I will now respond to the """"sources"""" that you have provided.

Have you realised that this source is not credible contrary to all the sources cited? Have you also realised that the author referred to the Kingdoms of Sine and Saloum as Wolof states?  Even the least verse on Senegambian history can easily find out for themselves that the Kingdom of Sine and Kingdom of Saloum were Serer Kingdoms not Wolof never mind a supposed scholar.   
Further, all the sources, historical and archaeological evidence shows that the Senegambian stone circles were built by the Serer people. (See: Gravrand, Pangool; Gamble, Salmon and Njie; Burke and Else; and F. Richard).

Since they were built by the Serers, and evidence have shown that they are built well before the 14th century, how then could the Serers have migrated into the area into the 14th century?  That doesn’t make sense.  Now the Serers may have migrated to from the Nile Valley as implied by Henri Gravrand in “La Civilisation Sereer, Pangool”, which is one of the sources cited in the article,  but as noted by Gravrand, if they did came from the Nile it was more than 5 thousand years ago and certainly not the 14th century. Further, as demonstrated by Gamble, Salmon and Njie, the Serer are the oldest inhabitants of Senegambia, others later moved in.  This backs up archealogical source, backs up Gravrand, Kleine, Richard  and so on.  
If your source was referring to the Guelwars of Kaabu coming from Kaabu to Sine in the 14th century at least I could understand that because it was at that time the Battle of Turubang (1335) occurred as stated by Sarr, Becker and others.  Even the Wolofs were already present long before the 14th century never mind the Serer people who have been present for thousand of years. Further as substantiated in the article with credible sources which all backs up each other, the Almoravid wars on Takrur due to religion (Islam) led to the Serers of Takrur who were finally defeated in Battle to leave Takrur and headed south.  That was in the 11th century during Abu-Bakr Ibn-Umar and War Jabi.  Even those “Takrurien” Serers came south long before the 14th century to join their other Serer relatives (See Daggs).

What I dislike about your proposed version is that it doesn't carry the forms / aspects distinction which was the point of my proposal. I think it's extremely important to have this distinction in mind. a) If we're going to keep """"political liberalism"""" in there, we need to call it an """"aspect"""", because no liberal objects to what's been called """"political liberalism"""" here, so it doesn't exactly make sense to call it a """"form"""" of liberalism which people argue over. b) The reason I insist on this is that modern political ideologies borrow certain aspects of liberal thought, and then abandon others. The """"aspects"""" division gives people the power to understand the influence of the liberal tradition by comparing it to other ideologies with these categories in mind. The perfect example is that of """"social conservatives"""" who (can be) economically liberal without being socially liberal.
In any case, if the forms/aspects division is tossed, then I'd rather that those sections called """"cultural"""" and """"political"""" liberalism also be removed, or placed in a different section, since they already describe essential / noncontroversial issues within liberalism.

 Origin 
Parts of this article particularly the """"Origin Section"""" not only failed to cite reliable sources, it also left out material facts as regards to the true origin of Takrur (also spelt Tekrur).  In this regard, it totally left out the history of the Serer people (also spelt """"Serere"""", """"Seereer"""", """"Sérère"""" and """"Sereer"""") who are not only the oldest inhabitants of Senegambia along with the Jola people (Source: Gambian Studies No. 17. People of The Gambia. I. The Wolof. By David P. Gamble & Linda K. Salmon with Alhaji Hassan Njie. San Francisco 1985.)  to which Takrur is part of, but the article gives the impression that Takrur was founded by the Fula people and/or only the Fula when both historical and archaeological sources contradicts that claim.  In fact, at the date and time of raising this article for discussion, no attempt was made by certain people to acknowledge the trutful history of the Serer people who resided at Takrur or Tekrur. Edits I had previously made were vandanlised by a certain person with false and ridiculous accusations. As such, I call all interested parties for an open discussion before I start making further edit on this article.  That aside, there is no mention of the Serer people in this article.  It is a fact that members of the Serer group have resided in Takrur for milleniums, ruled it, implanted their own royal dynasty as well as their ancient religion (The Serer Religion or """"Fat Rog"""").  

The following is a quote from Henry Gravrand, author of """"La Civilisation Sereer Pangool"""" who also authored """"La Civilisation Sereer Cossan"""":

""""Since the publication of """"Cossan"""" (history), I took as a starting point of the Sereer story in Tekrur over 2000 years ago, I noted an important discovery. In the middle of the Sahara, in the Tasili the rock carvings listed by Henri L'hote, appears the traces of the present """"Sereer Cossan"""" (Serer history) or their ancestors, a period dating back to the third or fourth millennium. This engraving represents the Sereer initiation Star (Serer Cosmology),  with two coiled snakes, symbols of the """"Pangool"""" (ancestral spirits also ancient Serer Saints in the Serer Religion)... The rock where the Star appears is the Sereer symbols of the Pangool which was probably a place of worship.""""  (Source: Henry Gravrand. La Civilisation Sereer - Pangool.  Published by Les Nouvelles Editions Africaines du Senegal. 1990. Page 9. ISBN: 2-7236-1055-1.)

The history of the Serer people who resided at Tekrur, the influence of their culture, history, religion and tradition on the land should not and cannot be erased from history.  To quote Issa Laye Thiaw, author of """"La Femme Seereer"""":

""""If the term """"“religiosity"""" expresses the commitment or devotion to a particular religion, it also applies to the Serer who are jealously attached to their traditional values and show little interest in respect of religions from outside.
However, few people adhere to these religions and gradually move away from the religion of the land.   The latter is the object of aggression and distortion on the part of some Muslims, to weaken the impact in people's minds. In this context, their Serer neighbours assigned names and adjectives to things they have invented from scratch, trying to prove their superiority and that of their religion (the Serer Religion)…. The Serers are so far, one of the few people of Senegal who are not yet fully converted to a modern foreign religion…. Obstinately attached to the religion of their ancestors, the Serers refused to change the social and religious life inherited from their ancestors, making every effort to prevent the penetration of foreign religions in their country.  Only recently were they superficially converted to Islam and Christianity.""""  
(Source: Issa Laye Thiaw. """"La Religiosite de Seereer, Avant et pendant leur Islamisation"""". Ethiopiques no: 54, Revue semestrielle de Culture Négro-Africaine. Nouvelle série, volume 7, 2e Semestre 1991.)

Issa Laye Thiaw's remarks about Islam is absolutely relevant as far as this article is concerned. For a more detailed explanation of what Issa Laye Thiaw is referring to when he said """"The latter is the object of aggression and distortion on the part of some Muslims, to weaken the impact in people's minds"""" please refer to Maba Diakhou Bâ's discussion page.

You are welcome; it is a shame that Bispham High School Arts College got caught in the crossfire.

"The notion that this book has not been refuted is a joke. 

Even former Foreign Minister, Shlomo Ben Ami, says in his book, Scars of War, Wounds of Peace, that there was an ethnic cleansing of the Palestinians:

The reality on the ground... was that of an Arab community in a state of terror facing a ruthless Israeli army whose path to victory was paved not only by its exploits against the regular Arab armies, but also by the intimidation, and at times atrocities and massacres, it perpetrated against the civilian Arab community. A panic-stricken Arab community was uprooted under the impact of masacres that would be carved into the Arabs' monument of grief and hatred... Benny Morris['s] thesis about the birth of the refugee problem being not by design but by the natural logic and evolution of the war is not always sustained by the very evidence he himself provides...Ben-Gurion...also instructed that abandoned Arab villages needed to be settled by Jews even before the end of hostilities.... Israel's formal rejection of the refugees' claim for return — a position that remains intact to this day — rather than the expulsion and dispossession, is the real defining moment of the conflict..

Israel as a society also suppressed the memory of its war against the local Palestinians because it could not really come to terms ith the fact that its finest Sabras, the heroes of its war for independence and the role models of the new nation, expelled Arabs, committed atrocities against them, and dispossessed them.

 WorldNet TPS 

Hi,

It appears that you have deleted a page which I had created. The page was titled 'WorldNet TPS'. I feel it was unfairly deleted.

The purpose of the page is to provide Wikipedia users with some background/history regarding WorldNet TPS. WorldNet is the second largest payment service provider in Ireland and it is important that web users who choose not to use the WorldNet website (worldnettps.com) can access information regarding the company on the most popular encyclopaedia in the world.

I would like you to review your decision to delete the WorldNet TPS page.

Kind Regards,

Mark  — Preceding unsigned comment added by  (talk • contribs)  

 The page was nominated for deletion as explained on your talk page because but it did not indicate how or why the subject is important or significant. There were no independent sources to establish notability. Please see Wikipedia:Your first article for guidance.  talk 

Would these documents suffice as notability?

It's not really up to me to decide, although one of the links is a blog and another a press release so probably not. I didn't delete the article, I nominated it for deletion and an admin then reviewed it and deleted it. Check out the link I gave you above and if you think you can establish notability you can recreate the article - this time properly referenced or you can submit an Article for Creation so that it can be reviewed before being created.

Baroque Guitars are NOT """"ten-string guitars""""
Andrew, frankly, you are mistaken. It is incorrect to refer to a baroque guitar as a """"ten-string guitar"""". No one refers to the baroque lute as """"the 24-string lute"""", but correctly as the 13-course lute. This is a well-established musicological/organological convention. """"12-string guitar"""" is the only exception to this, and that is only because the term has been disseminated by the popular """"cult(ure)"""" in the usual brainwashed ignorance of the masses. If two strings function as one string, they are a COURSE, not two separate strings. In contrast, a ten-stringed guitar has ten separate strings each of which can be separately fretted. This is not the case on the baroque guitar, which effectively only has five courses. Moreover, the term """"ten-string"""" guitar has come to signify a particular instrument, which is NOT a baroque guitar. You are evidently not a musicologist/organologist/semiologist/semantician so I don't see what you think you will achieve by being bothersome about this issue, which relates to organology and semantics.""",0

"Questions for the Wikipedia Signpost 

Hi!  My name is Ral315, and I'm the editor-in-chief of the Wikipedia Signpost, a weekly newspaper on the English Wikipedia.  I'm sending out an optional questionnaire that I hope you'll respond to.  These questions will be published in next week's issue, and hopefully translated into many languages and copied to the Meta-Wiki prior to the election.  (So, if you speak multiple languages, it'd be fantastic, though certainly not required, if you'd be willing to translate your answers into any languages you speak fluently.)

There's no word limit on any of these questions, but I suggest that brevity (maybe about 300-400 words per answer) is best.  If at all possible, answers should be submitted by 16:00 UTC on Monday, June 25 (though late responses will also be accepted).

I'm posting these to your talk pages because they don't really fit well on question pages (since many will repeat questions you've already answered).  You can reply to me by e-mail, or at my English Wikipedia, English Wikinews or Meta talk pages.

Thanks again for answering these, and good luck in the elections.

Sincerely,
Ral315

Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, with a strict neutral point of view policy and that the self-introduction companies often give on their own websites will often not be accepted here.
Using Wikipedia in order to increase publicity of oneself or one's company is discouraged, see what Wikipedia is not.

Please check that Auriga Logic meets, or at least comes close to meeting some of the WP:CORP guidelines to see whether a Wikipedia article on the company is worthwile in the first place.

The CCSP SAP 1.1 Executive Summary states:

""""Previously reported discrepancies between the amount of warming near the surface and higher in the atmosphere have been used to challenge the reliability of climate models and the reality of humaninduced global warming. Specifically, surface data showed substantial global-average warming, while early versions of satellite and radiosonde data showed little or no warming above the surface. This significant discrepancy no longer exists because errors in the satellite and radiosonde data have been identified and corrected. New data sets have also been developed that do not show such discrepancies."""" 
The IPCC Fourth Assessment Report Summary for Policymakers states:

""""New analyses of balloon-borne and satellite measurements of lower- and mid-tropospheric temperature show warming rates that are similar to those of the surface temperature record and are consistent within their respective uncertainties, largely reconciling a discrepancy noted in the TAR.""""

True. Both libertarians and conservatives in the modern Western world want low taxes, small government and individual freedom and responsibility. However, the difference is that libertarianism is a fixed ideology, while conservatism as an ideology varies between time periods and societies; for instance, nineteenth-century conservatism was about preserving monarchical and aristocratic rule and was totally different from modern conservatism. I think the quote I added to the first paragraph sums that up quite well: """"who are the 'conservatives' in today's Russia? Are they the unreconstructed Stalinists, or the reformers who have adopted the right-wing views of modern conservatives such as Margaret Thatcher? Basically, conservatism, when considered across the whole of history, is a term so vague as to be impossible to define - which makes this article inherently fairly impossible to write.

"""

Hi, everybody. I just stumbled by this little edit war, and would like to make a few suggestions. As this article stands, it's a jumbled mess. I believe that Marie is correct, in that some semblance of encyclopedic structure needs to be used in this article. I have great respect for Logger9's expertize in these subjects that so greatly interest me, and his willingness to back everything up with a source. However, to Logger9, I think a liitle guidance may be helpful in composing a proper encyclopedia structure. Encyclopedic writing is not like scientific writing.

To make it simple, an encyclopedia needs to be written in a journalistic format. The most important information is delivered as quickly as possible, in the first few sentences. This is done using the fewest amount of words possible, and should written so even a child can make snese of it, (at a 6th grade level). We call this the """"lede,"""" and the only purpose of the lede is to answer the question, """"What is a liquid?"""" It should be no more than a paragraph or two.

On a subject such as this, an """"intro"""" section would be appropriate. This is just an expanded lede. This may seem a bit redundant, but is actually extremely useful. Some people coming to this article will know absolutely nothing about science, and don't want the feeling of being thrown into a college level class head first. The intro should be written at about a 10th grade level, explaining the scientific aspects in the simplest of terms. (Imagine you're teaching a 10th grade science class. How would you explain it to them?)

Then, the following sections should get into college level explanations. It is perfectly acceptable to describe well established theories, and the histories behind those theories, but be careful to make it brief. The article is meant to answer the question of what a liquid is, and should not stray into the History of liquid theory. Also, when giving theory, realize that a scientific theory is really just a very well thought opinion, and should be attributed to its source. Under no circumstances should we combine theories in a way that might lead the reader to a third conclusion, unintended by the original sources. Nor should we give the impression that any theory is somehow absolute truth.

Also, you will find that most readers want information to be in its correct place. I have seen instances in the past where information was copied and pasted directly from one article to the next. This sort of redundency is usually unnecessary. It's better to add a link to the article where the info is most relevant. And, it is also very distasteful in writing to copy, even from oneself. If it is absolutely necessary to have the same info in multiple articles, then the writing should still be original. The goal is to make articles succinct ... to fulfill the readers curiosity about a subject and only that subject, but to link to any related subject that may further the reader's knowledge. By using this format, it helps satisfy everyone's curiosity before they become bored and move on.

To Marie, I'm glad you explained that English is not your first language, because at first I did think the tone was a little harsh, but now it makes sense. I think Logger9 has some very useful contributions to make, so I'd love to see a discussion on how to incorporate them into appropriate places. I'm fascinated by the science, and would love it if we all could work together to make it understandable to all. (I'm sure you both are far more knowledible than I am.) To everybody, please use your edit summaries! There are many people watching, and edit summaries save us all alot of time.   """,0

Let me give you people who love this guy/girl Deepak....An idea of what Deepak is like....He must be some really unhappy person......i promoise you this is what it is like in dealing with Deepak. 

I bring up an issue where im asking why an article does not have more info, or about editing an article, or about taking something out of an article. 

And Deepak wont allow me to make edits. 

So I give Deepak examples and information and trying to back up my edits are legit. 

And Deepak ignores my logic and doesnt give me alot of logic as to why my info is not valid then 

So I try to figure out why Deepak is being so strcit. I remind him that i backed up what i said. That i had information that was logical. And why my edits are good. 

And Deepak calls me a troll and insults me and accuses me of being a nazi lover or something

So I answer every insult, every accustation , and every put down that Deepak gives me. And then i remind him of why my edits are valid.

And Deepak ignores most of what i write and continues to call me a troll. Or a nazi lover. Or other insults. 

I then get annoyed and ask Deepak why is he ignoring most of my logic that i write down? Why does he pick and choose what he wants to answer? Why does he not give me logic in return? 

And Deepak wont reply . 

I then ask other users about making edits and asking them about my logic and giving them my reasons as to why my edits are valid. And some answer and some agree and some dont. 

And Deepak all of a sudden starts responding again....with logic? No....with answers? no....with reasoning? no....with information? no....he tells the other users that im a troll and a nazi and pro India then . 

I then answer all of Deepaks insults. I remind him of why i want edits to be made. I give him my information as to why  my edits are valid then. 

And Deepak goes back calling me a troll, and a nazi, and a pro India dude. 

And this kind of stuff goes on and on and on...you get the idea.....he ignores information you give him. He picks and chooses what he wants to answer. And he doesnt even answer the logic you give him sometimes. But he wastes his time in name calling, and insluts, and putting you down then. 

So then after a while i get annoyed. And i remind him how things got this bad between us. I type and type and type and type just like i am now. 

And Deepak ignores most of what i typed. 

Many times i write him these long replies where i answer all his points, where i tell him why its wrong for him to insult me and put me down, and why its wrong for him to ignore the information i have as to why i want to make an edit, or whatever it is im bringing up then.....and no matter how much i write....even if i write these long replies to him then....even if i answer every point he brings up....he usually either ignores most of what i wrote down....or....he picks and chooses what he wants to answer.....or.....he just responds back by calling me a troll, or accusing me of being pro nazi or something, or accusing me of ignoring his points (which is so not true cus i respond to pretty much everything he says then), or accusing me of not understanding what he is telling me, or just accusing me of being pro India then (which I am) or just insulting me, or just name calling me, or just putting me down. 

So then after a while i get so annoyed cus he's this a guy here then with me now, and so i start to call him names. I call him a dictator. I call him the ruler of wikiepdia. And I tell him how he ignores my points. 

And then Deepak tells me how i cant call him names, and how i cant throw mud at him, and how im breaking wikipedia rules

So then I ask him how comes its ok for him to name call me and i cant? How come its ok for him to throw mud at me but I cant then? How come its ok for him to break Wikipedia's rules but I can't then? 

And Deepak has no logical answer....or....he won't respond to those questions that I ask him then . Or he just ignores what i ask him, and goes back to accusing me of being a troll, or acting like im a pro nazi or something then , or just insult's me in general then......

So then I get more annoyed and call him thing's like a dictator, which as you can see here with our history, this is how he acts.....isn't it true?.....he ignores most of my points and picks and chooses what he wants to answer.....sometimes he won't even answer you at all.....and sometime's he just insults you then . So it's logical if get annoyed and call him a dicator right?

Wrong....Deepak then holds it against you that your name calling him...and threaten's to block you, or report you, or he just tel",1

Interesting reading, huh? Believe me now?  If you have time, and I'm sure you can find just a little more, go and find:  Is David Shankbone Wikipedia's Pornographer?  There you'll read:
But because my stalker hated Michael Lucas, as a farewell F.U. to him Michael and I decided to collaborate and produce some high-quality photos of what goes on during the making of an adult film.  Out of roughly 400 shots, I uploaded eleven.  Only one shot does not have the cameras, lights, operators, etc. in the shot (and that one is not explicit).  Most of the shots do not show genitalia.  Those are my reasons.  I'd be interested to hear what people think about all of this.  Am I """"Wikipedia's pornographer""""?
So there you have it: Shankbone admits to collaborating with Lucas to upload pornographic photos from Lucas's studio onto WP as a final F U to his alleged """"stalker""""  not to enrich WP, but to say F U to some unknown random IP.  And he uploaded the pics more than a few days before his breakdown and departure.  Does COI come to mind?

pjacobi: Delete - one person's theory, not in any way in contact with academic reserach. Pjacobi  

My response: Who cares how many people wrote it, or whether it is """"in contact with academic reserach""""? If you want to read about things that are """"in contact with academic reserach"""", you should subscribe to academic journals. Wikipedia is not an appendage of academia, and the CTMU nowhere relies on """"contact with academic reserach"""" to make its points. Please, let's keep our eyes on the ball here. Asmodeus  

Now please read carefully.

1. Most theories are written by one person; others are free to utilize them (or not) in their own work later on down the line, as they choose. That others have not yet chosen to do so need not reflect on the theory or its applicability to important issues, particularly given the polarization associated with the central focus of the scholastic journal in which the CTMU was published. This is not necessarily a reflection on the theory; it is more likely pertinent to the philosophical assumptions under which others are working, which - inasmuch as we are, after all, talking about philosophy - may ultimately lead nowhere. Indeed, it may merely mean that other scholars are unfamiliar with the theory because they only pay attention to a narrow or professionally closed set of sources. You have improperly recommended this article for deletion on those grounds, and that was wrong of you as a Wikipedia editor.

This leads us to

2. It makes no difference whether a theory is """"notable to academic researchers"""" (whether or not this is the case). It has been patiently explained to you that academics are not the ones who make this particular theory notable; it is notable because it was covered by highly reputable sources in the popular media, and because it has a remarkable structure that no other theory possesses. Again, citing the superficially apparent inattention of academia as grounds for deletion was irresponsible of you as a Wikipedia editor.

You have voted to delete an informative, well-verified article about a notable topic on irrelevant or nebulous grounds for which you have no verification. In so doing, you have let Wikipedia and its readership down. Please be more responsible about your editing activities in the future.  """,0

I have, unfortunately, to aknowledge the fact that your latest actions have resulted in creating a turmoil on the site, based both on your actions and your utterings, and that you have provocated 50% of the users, who had already been harshly provocated by user r-b-j for several weeks and needed therefor the administrators help to put an end to it, not to overtake the place of the source of turmoils.

I do believe that you are acting your best with your actual knowledge of the facts, but nonetheless you should be more carefull to don't bruise som ego by commiting unfully justified and unjust actions in the process, and as a consequence endanger the quality of the talk page.

As those arguments for and against have been dancing in parallel for far too long time, without everreaching a solid ground of agreement, and as references made by anti bogdanov are always pointed at some unclear statement made by scientifics a long time ago, where most did redraw it, and as all those people of science didn't knew a thing about Theoretical Physic and/or Cosmologie, which this dispute is about, and as the positiv statements, made by specialists in the fields named above, are systematically unaccepted for tricky reasons, as are the statements made on this page by pro-bogdanovian, who are called socket puppets for a yes or for a no, I suggest this affair to be settled once and for all by truly and undiscustably specialists in that field, I named Holger Beck Nielsen professor of the Copenhague Niels Bohr Institut of Theoretical Physic, and Stephen W. Hawking, from the Chair of Mathematic of Cambridge University.

I have already made the necessary steps in order to bring professor Holger Beck Nielsen attention to that matter, and would like to know if anyone feel of doing the same in England.
I tried already to suggest this approach above, but it seems that my suggestion was drawned in the tumults of the fights and remained ignored.

Why Korean comfort women?

Why Korean comfort women during Korean War and why Korean collaborators? Because it is true. It all happened and it was all discuss probably before you were born. So we look to the academics and newspapers for reference.

From, The Construction of US Camptown Prostitution in South Korea: Transformation and Resistance by Lee, Na Young, 2006
 
'The term “comfort women” (wianbu) to refer to military prostitutes serving American soldiers signals the widespread acceptance of camptown prostitution as an inevitable means to entertain foreign soldiers. This term was commonly used in newspaper articles throughout the 1950s along with such phrases as “prostitutes catering to UN soldiers” and terms like yanggongju (Western princesses), or “UN madams” (woman getting a livelihood by serving UN soldiers).129 This usage continued during the 1960s and 1970s when camptown prostitution became more differentiated from non-U.S. military prostitution.  The Korean government’s policy on prostitution reflected its public’s perspectives on prostitution, which was, in the decades after the war, regarded as a necessary means to feed Korea’s impoverished population.'

The Chosun Ilbo or Daily News is major newspapers in South Korea 2,200,000 readers. Examples given are in Chosun Ilbo 23 August, 1960, it mentions, """"In Pup’yLng, some 150 'comfort women dealing with American troops'. Similar reports using the words """"comfort women"""" are: KyLnghyang Ilbo, 11/25/1955; Chosun ilbo, 11/08/1957; Chosun ilbo, 8/23/1960; Chosun ilbo, 12/03/1963. A “Comfort Women’s demonstration” is also reported in 1966. 

In the mid- to late-1960s, there were numerous articles in Chosun ilbo reporting crimes committed against camptown prostitutes by American soldiers that continued to used the term 'comfort women'. Korea college girls recruited for the Nangnang Club were also viewed as """"yanggongju"""" or comfort women (Seoul Sinmun 26 July, 1952; 10 October, 1953). Post-war military brothels were still known as comfort stations and the system based on the Japanese one.

In 1958, the Chosun ilbo also accounts for the number of women involved as 300,000. The women who served “one American husband” were called “yangbuin” (Western madam) instead of the usual """"yanggalbo"""" (western whore) who were generally treated by Korean society as “non-human beings”. Generally, the Yanggongju have been ignored in official Korean histories as a national shame until recent. 

Song-gun Chong in 1967 wrote, 3,000 so-called “comfort women” registered with the  Health Section of the Military and the Military Police Corps of the U.S. Army (“Current Situations of Korean Prostitutes and Countermeasures.” Pophak-nonchong 8:65-87.)

""":::: sprot only blocks IP (and brand new) addresses from editing - it does not stop anyone from reading, nor does it stop anyone who wants to contribute to create an account with an unidentifiable and untraceable name (i.e., don't give your email address) and contribute.  The edits made by multiple IP addresses on this page, as you know,  have been (not always but  by and large) at best unhelpful but much more often downright offensive and I see absolutely no reason why that should be allowed to continue.  Again, you know I am not talking about the juvenile HI MOMs - they are also annoying, but that is not what plagues this page.  We are plagued by targeted vandalism - changing """"Obama"""" to """"Osama"""", for example, and the regular changing of text that has hidden text clearly requesting that it not be changed right there, plus blatant POV pushing, trolling, etc.  Classic case for permanent sprot. The result, when sprot is in place, is the ability to conscientiously edit and improve the article (which has a changing base of facts so needs constant attention).  But rather than being able to easily evaluate substantive changes that responsible editors make, we are bogged down in having to go through screen after screen of pure and often vicious vandalism. For what positive reason, may I ask?

IP edits also can be used, I suppose, by regular editors who don't want to reveal that they are making sub rosa changes, but I would hope that is not going on here.  

And IP addresses have quite rarely reverted vandalism here - in fact I just looked at the last 500 edits and didn't see a single case of an IP address reverting vandalism. Maybe I missed one, but that claim was not really reflective of what goes on on this page - it is a very small group of actual editors who do the vast majority of the reverting.  

Your comment above about there being only one vandalism on Dec 21 was just one day after sprot was lifted the last time. I said then that I hoped to be wrong, but predicted that vandalism would be back up and it is.  That's why I requested extended protection.

If what  you were unhappy about is the tag itself, I also thought all along that we should have {{sprotect2}} and had thought to change it last time but the block was lifted before I had a chance to.   I have changed it to that less obtrusive tag.  The question of the duration  of the lock is what I am interested in. Two-three weeks is much better than what we had a few weeks ago, and may coincide with any announcement that Senator Obama makes which is also good timing for sprot, but  I'd like to understand why you would want it not to be an extended one, because I can't make any sense out of your position on this, as a person (you, I mean) who clearly is interested in having this remain a high quality page, as evidenced by the excellent work you do here, and the fact that this page has been by far your main area of Wikipedia editing.    | talk

"Consulting Dictionary.com, I could find “publically” accepted by only one authority — WordNet®, whereas “rôle” is accepted by Dictionary.com Unabridged (v 1·1), The American Heritage® Dictionary of the English Language (Fourth Edition), the Kernerman English Multilingual Dictionary (wherein it is listed as the primary spelling), The American Heritage® Stedman’s Medical Dictionary, and Merriam–Webster’s Medical Dictionary; therefore, I don’t think that they’re comparable. Rôle is the original spelling, and remains perfectly standard to this day. Diacritical and other supra-ASCII spellings are often omitted in typed text, but that can in a great many (perhaps the majority of) situations be explained by the effort that must be invested in order to insert the necessary character(s) using a basic keyboard.

Disruptive editing
In my view the collaborative editing team working to make this a FA has shown extreme tolerance in accommodating the concerns of User:Skipsievert. This latest """"tagging"""" follows a full consideration and resolution of COI issues on the appropriate noticeboard. Repeated editing of resolved or previously discussed issues is part of the pattern of disruptive editing. Below is part of the content of the WP entry on disruptive editing:

How disruptive editors evade detection 

Disruptive editing already violates site policy, yet certain editors have succeeded in disrupting articles and evading disciplinary action for one of several possible reasons:

 their edits occur over a long period of time; in this case, no single edit may be clearly disruptive, but the overall pattern is disruptive
 their edits are largely confined to talk-pages, such disruption may not directly harm an article, but it often prevents other editors from reaching consensus on how to improve an article
 their edits often avoid gross breaches of civility, especially by refraining from personal attacks, even though they interfere with civil and collaborative editing meant to improve the article
 their edits remain limited to a small number of pages that very few people watch
 conversely, their edits may be distributed over a wide range of articles that few people watch.

 Signs of disruptive editing 

This guideline concerns gross, obvious and repeated violations of fundamental policies, not subtle questions about which reasonable people may disagree.

A disruptive editor is an editor who:

 Is tendentious: continues editing an article or group of articles in pursuit of a certain point for an extended time despite opposition from one or more other editors. Tendentious editing does not consist only of adding material; some tendentious editors engage in disruptive deletions as well.
 Cannot satisfy Wikipedia:Verifiability; fails to cite sources, cites unencyclopedic sources, misrepresents reliable sources, or manufactures original research.
 Engages in """"disruptive cite-tagging""""; adds unjustified  tags to an article when the content tagged is already sourced, uses such tags to suggest that properly sourced article content is questionable.
 Does not engage in consensus building:
 repeatedly disregards other editors' questions or requests for explanations concerning edits or objections to edits;
 repeatedly disregards other editors' explanations for their edits.
 Rejects community input: resists moderation and/or requests for comment, continuing to edit in pursuit of a certain point despite an opposing consensus from impartial editors.
In addition, such editors may:
 Campaign to drive away productive contributors''': act in spite of policies and guidelines such as Wikipedia:Civility, Wikipedia:No personal attacks, Wikipedia:Ownership of articles, engage in sockpuppetry/meatpuppetry, etc. on a low level that might not exhaust the general community's patience, but that operates toward an end of exhausting the patience of productive rules-abiding editors on certain articles.

Refusal to 'get the point'

In some cases, editors have perpetuated disputes by sticking to an allegation or viewpoint long after the consensus of the community has rejected it, repeating it almost without end, and refusing to acknowledge others' input or their own error. Often such editors are continuing to base future attacks and edits upon the rejected statement. Such an action is disruptive to Wikipedia. Thinking one has a valid point does not confer the right to act like it is an accepted rule when it is not.

The editing team has expressed the view that reasonable verified and substantiated requests will be given full consideration. However, IMO the recent spate of """"refusing to get to the point"""", repeated """"tagging"""" total disengagement with """"consensus building"""", """"ignoring of requests for explanations"""", """"ignoring moderator suggestions"""", """"rapid negative engagement with new contributors"""" all spell out the pattern of disruptive editing that has long-delayed completion of this collective effort, and it deserves disciplinary action.

"There are two criteria at play here: first, does it bear the Final Fantasy title, in any form or region? This covers most of what we've got. Second, if the first does not apply, does it feature a major appearance by characters or settings strongly associated with the Final Fantasy series. Kingdom Hearts does, since about half of the major NPCs are from the series. Ehrgeiz does, since it has several playable characters (one of whom is actually on the cover of the game) from Final Fantasy VII. Secret of Evermore might, as well: I was under the impression that the appearances were more along the lines of brief cameos that integral roles, but if someone wants to argue otherwise, I'm listening.

That's when I realized it was probably a misunderstanding so I decided to message you and let you know.

I never said they would be expelled.  I said they do not meet the eligibility requirements to be a Scout.  The only way an avowed homosexual can both understand and agree to live by the Scout Oath and Law is to lie.  Of course, he is also violating his promise to be Trustworthy in the process. He does not meet the eligibility requirements to be a Scout.  He intentionally violates the Scout Oath and Law, and he intents to continue violating the Scout Oath and Law.  But he could join and remain in Scouting nonetheless, by telling lies.  I imagine, at any given time, there are thousands of Scouts who are regularly violating the Scout Oath and Law, who intend to continue doing so, and still remain in Scouts.  But that doesn't change the fact the Scout Oath is what it is, that BSA believes that homosexual behavior violates the Scout Oath, and that these Scouts are not qualified to be Scouts.

==Matt Sanchez response, clarifications and demand for apology from Robertissimo

Robertissimo, I beg to differ.  The """"couple of mentions on Fox"""" were full segments on the O'Reilly Factor, a debate on Hannity and Colmes, a full segment on Fox and Friends, a segment on Neil Cavuto and another segment on ABC News, an op-ed in the New York Post and the Marine Corps Post.  I was given the Jeane Kirkpatrick Award principally because I not only defended myself in all these forums, but Iaccording to the award citationupheld a standard of academic freedom in the face of adversity.  I take great issue with your claim of my """" admission in that article that he was also an escort"""".  No such admission was made, i was trying to make a rhetorical comparison between payment for porn as a proxy to a form of prostitution.  I made this point on SEVERAL occasions on the Alan Colmes show.  I was on Alan's show four times.  I take your statement as offensive, cowardly, counter-productive and demand an apology.  I understand that wiki contributors are supposed to be much more subtle in their criticism, however Robertissimosomeone, to my knowledge, that I have never methas shown great disdain for me by publicly calling me a liar, prostitute or worsean imprecise writer.  
If you, Mr Robertissimo hold me in such low regard, why are you interested in contributing to this article?  That's a fair question.  If Mr Robertissimo refuses to apologize, I'd like some advice on how to handle this matter appropriately.  Editors as the faceless Mr Robertissimo should keep in mind that I am a real person and not some """"wiki curiosity"""". 

Robertissimo's comments on the Marine Corps status shows an entire lack of knowledge of these type of procedures, both formal and informal and his assessment is frankly simplistic.  These issues have been discussed ad nauseum, but angry activists still believe they can """"hurt me"""" through this Wikipedia article.  With all due respect to Mr Robertissimo (none of which he has shown me), where did he suddenly come from?    Are we heading back toward editing wars as the dishonest and biased attempt to further their agenda?  Given the history of this article and the number of, frankly, shady characters who have appeared and disappeared on this page, my concerns are merited.  

Out of curiosity, why hasn't any emphasis been placed on """"further investigating"""" the allegations made against me by U-Haul and the Veterans organization? The Marine Corps Times printed the """"allegations"""", but I haven't seen editors on this talk page bringing up that issue.  It is disturbing, distracting and tedious to have to """"defend"""" myself from the likes of character such as Mr. Robertissimo et al...This page was not meant for that purpose and I would like for civility to return.  I fear there has been a further infiltration by former editors who had been resoundingly banned from these pages.  Can anyone comment?
Writing vs. Edits.  I originally cited a comparison between myself and Rich Merritt (who happens to be my neighbor).  I was told the Salon reading audience would not recognize the former pornstar alias USMC Captain Merritt .  The Salon editor, Mark Schone, inserted Jeff Gannon as Mr Gannon is somewhat of a lightrod for the Salon readership's disdain.  I've made this statement before on at least three occasions (please consult the archives).  
In reality, Merritt's story is entirely dissimilar to my own as Merritt was performing in adult films while on active duty. My last film of record was in the winter of '94, nearly a decade before my enlistment in the Marine Corps.  The comparison between myself and Gannon is also passing at best, as Jeff was considered to be a type of interloper/doppleganger with insider knowledge given to him surreptitiously from some shadowy figure/network within the Bush administration or the Republican party.  In my case, there was no doubt of my identity as a Marine, my status as a student at Columbia University, the subsequent changes that were effected in the student and city policy regarding the discrimination of veterans and the specific description of those veterans were all real and documented.  I also had NO inside help or sway with any party or organization, including (unfortunately) the Columbia Milvets organization.  There was never a question that I wrote the articles I wrote, nor was there a hint of some """"higher up"""" working behind the scenes to help me.  There was also never a doubt that I had merited the CPAC Award. I was unanimously elected according to the event's organizers.  I was even congratulated for courage after standing up to the political roasting after unsourced bloggers revealed my past and attempted to link me (rather poorly) with an anti-gay rights agenda.

Notes for the blind communist Castro lovers editing wikipedia and for the man himself

There seems to be a group of people around here in wikipedia with very strong leftist tendency that are very blind as to no recognize Castro for what he is. But not to worry. History will take care of him like it took care of Hitler and Stalin and other horrible dictators the people in the world have suffer.
There is a lot of talk in wikipedia about having a neutral POV but there is no such thing here. All the Castro's agents and lovers are here polishing his image probably getting paid with free vacations by the dictator at Varadero beach in Cuba while many true Cuban heroes die in prison just for opposing Castro and what he represents. A decadent regime, a waste of time for the Cuban people. 
Castro I know you or your agents will read this. So do not worry. History will take care of you and be assure that you will not look this good as it appear here. 
You could have been great a great leader if you had help Cuba get out of a dictator like Batista and then surrender power to the people to democracy! 
But you want to know something. You became worst than Batista the moment you started killing many innocent people just at the beginning of the revolution. You yourself killed the revolution with all the blood and with your unlimited greed for power. 
You claim Cuba is the most democratic country in the world. 

""""Right""""!How many people prefer to die on the tooth of a shark better than at your hands? How many desperate people abandon the  island? Because there is no other choice? or maybe because they are anyway dying an slow death at the hands of your regime, controlling every little bit of information as you an your agents are doing here at wikipedia. Cleaning up your image! 
It amazes me. Because this goes to show what you are. A megalomaniac! too worry about what history will tell about you, about what your legacy will be.
Do not worry Fidel Castro. I will let you know this. Do not even let yourself think for a second that you are at the same level as Jose Marti, Feliz Varela or even a Simon Bolivar. 
You do not get even up one inch in front of them in fact I can tell you that you go down for miles and miles.  
You must be full of envy about Chavez! because his got the oil money you never had! and because of it he can buy some people. But do not be! Some people are not for sale. Some people will not buy the lies you sell.
This is for you, all the leftist who have never live in a totalitarian regime, and who fantasize about Castro and Che I will also be sorry to disappoint you by telling you that you Castro that you are not  even at Che's level, yes the same one you made a martyr, an icon of the revolution, Your first patron saint. The same one you sell in t-shirts and postcards now and you profit from! 
That is because at least Che had principles, something you really do not know what it is or even fathom, 
he(Che) probably believe in communism and that it was a good thing because of his youth, while on the other hand you Castro  just used it for your own personal benefit and profit.

Ask yourself why Che die? why Camilo Cienfuegos die? and many others close to power in Cuba?

Many people said that Castro himself send someone to kill him! He just can not stand someone close to power(because he is very afraid to loose it he is paranoid about it,obsess with power , anybody close to him have to be very careful no to upset him or to contradict any of his ideas even the bad ones. Poor guys, I am sorry for them. 
 
Castro have subjugated and dominated the Cuban people who have suffer for years without end his power and very long rants. But no more.. Just like everything that is born some day you too Fidel Castro will also die sooner or later. Do not worry, when you die we the Cubans enjoying freedom will not celebrate your death but will rejoice about the change that will happen to our homeland after you will be gone. Sorry to see all the time wasted but not to worry. Cuba will be rebuild. All the Cuban blood you have spilled in and out of the country will not be in vane. You know why that will be? Because, Cubans will have learn their lesson. 

For you, all the leftist who have never live in a totalitarian regime, believe me if you impartially read all the news about Fidel Castro and check all his speeches from the very beginning of the revolution you can see his evolution. How power have corrupted him and his regime. How many innocent people have been kill in the name of the revolution? how much intolerance! how many times he has sell out his """"principles"""".

Do they mean their homes? I dont get the """"Sam Waterston is no longer at risk for being demolished to make way for a new CVS"""" part. Couldn't Sam just step outta the way? P Someone help me out here.

Peter the Hermit and Emerich's respective endeavours really have nothing to do with the actual First Crusade that was led by Godfrey, Raymond and Bohemond. Emerich in particular is totally unrelated, since he was a psychotic murderer who wasn't following the Church's teachings. Bishop Rothgard of Mainz tried to protect his Jewish neighbors from him.

 Please help me end this drama once in for all 

I really do hate to get start making accusations, but I feel as if User:Delicious carbuncle is seriously heading down a road of corruption. It all started over a simple proposal at WP:VILLAGE where I skeptically proposed an idea for a template similar to the Template:Romeo warning for silly vandals apparently belonging to cheerleading squads. DC then started questioning my actions at WP:ABUSE, in which case I appropriately addressed his concerns. However, he seems to possibly have a problem with either my involvement at the project or perhaps even the project as a whole. He posted my real life first name, high school, and high school mascot in an example, in which case I raised concerns of WP:OUTING (note that his previous block for outing is unrelated). He said that it was merely a random name he chose, and I've chosen to WP:AGF in the matter, and you may treat that matter however you so desire. After receiving a comment on his talk page from a blatant IP troll that's been harassing me for over a month, he decided to start looking into the trolls claims about my handling of a repeat offender mainly known here as User:LBHS Cheerleader. He started heatedly questioning my actions, asking for diffs about bans. I had removed a """"suspected sockpuppet"""" template stating that the user might be related to User:Bobabobabo (which I had added over a year ago) and replaced it with a banned template since although I feel it's inappropriate that we were using Boba's ban against LBHSC without evidence, I similiarily felt it was inappropriate to all of a sudden to consider her """"debanned."""" I also added LBHSC to the list of community banned users as it seemed to be a consensus to me. I probably should have discussed this first, but I did not in light of WP:BOLD and WP:DENY (I didn't want to start a thread without absolutely needing to). Per WP:DUCK, it seems pretty obvious that LBHSC and her minions have been vandalizing for quite some time, at least since 2006, probably ban-worthy. However, I gracefully removed the contested templates when Delicious carbuncle started a thread at WP:AN/I in attempt to calmly settle the issue, and even stated that I would voluntarily abandon my efforts to combat LBHSC's disruption (beyond non-controversial reverting of blatant vandalism of course). DC ruthlessly refused to compromise, and I even contemplated retirement if only to save my name """"PCHS-NJROTC."""" Even then DC was not satisfied. Several users argued that LBHSC should indeed be considered banned as she would likely never be unblocked, including highly respected admins. Many editors, administrators, and even members of the WP:ArbCom have expressed their opinion that DC should move on. Even an admin who felt I had acted out of line and should be blocked stated that there's not enough support to keep the discussion going. Although there were those who defended my actions 100%, felt that although that the user should be banned but I should have discussed first, felt that I was being power hungry, and even thought that my actions were abusive, the general consenus of everybody was that I had offered settlement, learned important lessons, and that good faith should be assumed. Despite consensus, DC continued to revive the discussion over and over again, providing nothing new, and basically insisting on action. He has been warned repeatedly by several respected editors. He had stopped, and I had disengaged. I really wish this could have stayed in the past. However, Delicious carbuncle started User:Delicious_carbuncle/PCHS-NJROTC_ban_redux in the dawn of the new year. Considering the edit summary he used when creating the page, I initially thought his intentions were to use that as an arguement against someone who he is in conflict with known as User:Neutralhomer. In desire to not be involved in his conflict, I nominated the page for deletion at WP:MFD. I viewed it simply as an attack page which did not help the encyclopedia. I could have nominated for WP:CSD, but I didn't want to say that he was """"attacking me"""" as I was in favor of disengagement as was recommended at AN/I. In response to the MfD, he indicated that he intends to start yet another ban discussion. I'm not sure if he's wanting a topic ban on vandalism as before (which really isn't even a topic) or an all out ban. I did indicate that I would not stay here if I was topic banned, and that I would just assume be renamed to something unaffiliated with me (i.e. Vandal Fighter Missing in Action) and then be fully banned, but thankfully there's no support for either a topic ban or all out ban. It's clear that disengagement is still prefered based on some comments at the MfD discussion. After the original p",0

In 1974 he claimed that he discovered an intricate numerical pattern in the text of the Qur'an involving the number 19 mentioned in verse 30 of chapter 74 of the Qur'an.
This may be inaccurate, his original work on numeric pattern did not connect pattern to 30:74, but I'll check. What we may be seeing here is later synthesis.   
Details of claim
The details of this analysis including tables are available in the back of his book, Quran, the Final Testament.[2]
This was not tagged, but needs attention anyway
The details shifted over the years, and what was published in the Final Testament is quite different from the earlier publications. So it is not """"this analysis,"""" i.e., the 1974 analysis.

 Issue on images still unresolved 

Slim, I'm copying this message and my reply to your page for your notice.

I appreciate your inputs in Image talk:Monkey3.jpg and I agree once in a while I might sound rude (purely unintentional, since I put facts blantly). But SlimVirgin is abusing his admin power to overrule anyone.

Slim is not a """"he"""". Given that she named herself after a Javanese princess, perhaps you could take the hint and note that she's a woman. Also, I don't think you were simply blunt. I think you were rude to Slim. I recognise it's a fine line but given that I've mentioned it to you, perhaps you'll take more care to stay on the right side of it?

She has suggested in an email to me, that she is in talks with another editor. Now, I don't know who this other editor and i certainly don't like this secrecy. Instead of having a discussion on this, she wants to finish the matter begind closed doors. She could've atleast told me who this reputed editor was to let me have a word with him/her.

Perhaps she is seeking guidance on how she should approach you and wants that to be untainted by your input. I think that would be reasonable. I have a high regard for Slim and I don't think she would have a nefarious purpose in speaking to a third party.

Inso far as the images are concerned, I had stated to her a couple of images on one issue (animal rights) is ok, but she insists she needs to showcase the entire album provided by PETA and its assocites.

So you have a dispute. You need to recognise that you are not necessarily right! You disagree about how many images are necessary. I feel that you have to allow that your disagreement might be fuelled by your political differences as much as how you interpret the image policy.

This should could easily achieve by providing an external link to the images provided by a controversial organization.

The BUAV is not a """"controversial organisation"""". It is a highly respected body, whose voice is listened to in all circles of British society. A viewpoint doesn't become """"controversial"""" just because you don't share it.

Wikipedia is supposed to be neutral and not have extreme viewpoints - 

But you expect it to reflect your viewpoint.

thus I requested her to limit her fair use policy in this regard to 2-3 images which can be used across similar articles. this she refuses.

I don't see how it is any fairer to use one, two or ten images in this instance. While I agree that Slim could have taken more care to provide a rationale for using the images, I simply don't feel that your argument about how many she should have used has much weight. One factor in deciding fair use is how much of a thing you use, that's true, but it's only one factor, and obviously, each picture is a separate case to be considered as well as part of a whole.

As far as the other images, some are on personalities she claims have """"agreed"""" to use their photos here. Unless she gets a written consent and a permission how can I believe.

First of all, you can believe Slim because you assume good faith. Perhaps you're not aware of that policy. Yes, you can ask Slim to provide evidence of that, but your assumption should be that she has in fact acquired that agreement. Harassing another editor to provide evidence to your satisfaction and insisting you won't believe them until they have do not show an assumption of good faith.

Once I pointed out that {permission} photos would be deleted anyway, she backed off and argued that it be kept on the grounds of fair use asking me to trust her.

Yes, okay. Trust her AND ask for proof.

Both of us are editing in good faith, but one of us has power and a circle of friends to back her while the other (me) relies on the hope that ppl. like you will help me out in this.

I'd urge you to rely on the issues rather than the personalities. Yes, Slim does have powerful friends, who will back her regardless, but you should still do your best to make it about the issue in question and not about her.

If she gets away with this and sets a precedence then I'm afraid there are hordes of copyviolaters straining at the leashes to bomb Wikipedia with copyrighted information.

''I think that's a bit dramatic but I agree that she has to obey the rules, which exist for good reason, and shouldn't be given a pass just because she is friends with the arbcom.

To make it short: according to Daniel Quinn the Antichrist is or are those, who love the world. Like John said that those, who love the world, don't have the love to God in them. Daniel Quinn also says that the Antichrist is more like an anti-saviour. If you wish, I could write something about all these ideas on the mainpage here. I just wasn't sure if I should do it or not.  0.39, 25 August 2006 (CEST)""",0

 YOUR CONCEPT OR RACE IS LUDRICOUS 

To ip 64.131, you are trying to impose """" one-drop rule myth"""", hyperdecent and other racist thrash from the legacy of Jim Crow into a country like DR. Ernesto Sagas is a Dominican professor at CUNY,and not even him accepts that thrash. You showed yourself.

   You showed a picture of Collin Powell? hahaha. That's not what I meant by """" white-skin"""" Dominicans. Collin Powell( a Mulatto, btw) is FAR from being """" white-skinned"""". I placed the suffix """" -skinned"""" on purpose. I meant by that, is that even when there is a mixture, the amount of European blood is much larger, thus giving the person """" White skin"""" and more European-like characteristics. Not somebody looking like Simbad. Ex:link title, [http://www.hoy.com.do/article.aspx?&id;=18092# link title.

  These people passed as White during the colonial period. If they have a grandfather looking like Collin Powells, then they cannot they are """" white"""" like some Viking let's say. But i'm wondering how come nobody is calling Bill Clinton a """" mestizo"""" since he had a Cherokee grandmother?? hmm. Nice North American double-standards, one-drop only applies when it comes to African decent only. 

  Anyways, I'm not here to discuss the """" screwed up concept of race"""" in other countries, but the reality of DR. The concensus here among Dominicans, is that the """" 90% African decent"""" is a vague statement, people that claim other heritages mixed, want to be classified as mixed, in the case of DR, as Mulattoes, because they DO VIEW themselves racially different from the Sammy Sosa-type Dominicans. platanogenius.""",0

I am surprised that it got reverted again to federal republic . The issue in question here is whether India is a union or a federation.

Unless the entire list or at least the tetrapod-like traits are reliably sourced (e.g. """"Smith (2001) lists these 11 traits as key tetrapod characteristics"""") the appearance is that you alone are advancing the view that all of these species and/or their traits are remarkable for their supposed tetrapod-like nature; assertions which may never have been explicitly made in reliable sources, and thus the list appears to be original synthesis.

"FK Vardar 

FK Vardar is a Macedonian Football club, the club changed its name several times during its history, from original Vardar in 1911 to Citizens Football Club Vardar or just Citizens( Gragjanski in Macedonian ) in 1920, then Football Club Makedonija in 1946 and finally back to FC Vardar in 1947. By the name FC Citizens( Vardar ) the club won 4 championships from 1936 till 1939. About Yugoslavia, you have to know that Yugoslavia was a federation of 6 Republics -countries together and each Republic had its own championship, and there was a Federal League where teams from the Republics competed together. Each Republic had its own Cup and the cup winners competed in the Marshals Cup, that cup was held in honor of Joseph Broz the marshal of the Federation, and its was called the Cup of the Marshal. How ever FC Vardar never won the Federal league ( League made of Federation of 6 Republics best teams ,thats why its called the Federal League, and not Yugoslavian League nor Yugoslavian Cup). The title in 1987 was won by FC Partizan Belgrade , you can check in any official statistics or documents. The second federal league was made of two Second Federal Leagues , East ( 3 Republics competed, Serbia ,Monte Negro,Macedonia and two Provinces- almost the same as Republics but yet without a nation ,those were Kosovo and Vojvodinship ) and West ( 3 Republics, Croatia, Bosnia and Slovenia, sometimes clubs from province Vojvodinship  would compete in the West depending on the federation decisions ). In the period of 1922 till 1929, present day Republic of Macedonia was established as 4 provinces within the Kingdom of Serbs Croats and Slovenes, those 4 provinces were Skopje, Bitola,Shtip and Vranje prvinces. These 4 provinces established the Macedonian Football Federation in 1926,and they held 3 championships. In 1929 these 4 provinces joined in one Duchy and this championship was held in the Duchy ( Banovina ) for 11 times.During the WW2 the championship was held under German Occupation, and the German government recognized this League. After the WW2 the very same championship was tranformed in to Republic Football League ,just the Province of Vranje was separated from the Republic as Macedonia transformed from Duchy to a Republic and the province of Vranje was under the newly made Republic of Serbia in 1946. The bottom line is since the Federation of 6 Republics split in the 90s, Macedonian Republic League was transformed in to Macedonian First League. So it is the same League that changed names and competition format during the decades, and now it came to this Level. Its a petty that there is lots of politics and territorial pretensions lots of denial of the existence of the Macedonia and other Republics in the Federation , by the Serbian side. Serbian official politic is to show that Yugoslavia was one country and nation mainly based on Serb character and they are stilling all the history including history of sports in this case football. They are trying to show the world that there was Yugoslav nation ( Serb ) and only Yugoslav Football league ( Serb League ) denying the Federal League second Federal League and Republic Leagues. They want to show only Yugoslav League and not the real Federal League. They hold all the champions from the Federal League as Serbian Champions in every competition. For FC Vardar at this point of view considering that  Macedonia is not in the Federetion for more than 20 years,and it wont be in the future ,the most important are the titles and trophies won in the Macedonian League , and if you wont to put additional trophies won in the Federation ,the period before 1991 you should write the precise information. Second Federal League East is the name of the competition, and you should put the Macedonian Flag from that period of the time next to it,instead of the federal flag, simply because that federation dont exist anymore and doesnt represent any country nor nation. About the cup , you should write down the real proper name as it was called ,Marshals Cup also fallowed by Macedonian flag from that period of the time, you should put a notice that in the Federal Second League East , clubs from Serbia Macedonia and Monte Negro competed including the provinces of Kosovo i Vojvodinship.",0

Orton = Does whatever the fuck he wants because he is a main star and friends with Triple H. Should have been fired already for smoking pot in front of everyone. If it wasn't for Triple H, he would be jobbing in TNA right now. Fuck him, that son of a bitch does not deserve the spot he has. He is good of the mic but ring skills lack, headlock after headlock.

Triple = Been playing politics for years and deserves to become a jobber for the people he has buried. He tried to keep Booker T and Kurt Angle down.

For the heterographical use of the Aramaic in the Persian cf. Segert (1990), 1.7.6.

 Re 

So the same goes for the person I insulted?

Let me help you to be just for one day unbiased:

 It is true that there are """"fringe"""" elements that do not believe in evolution.
 However, someone who did not believe in evolution would have a very difficult time getting into graduate school in biology in any respectable accredited school anyplace in the world.
 Aside from a few religious fundamentalists who somehow feel that evolution challenges their beliefs...
 The antievolutionists are in the same camp as people who believe in extraterrestrials abducting people or cows, or in the Loch Ness Monster, or ghosts, or vampires, or avoiding black cats, or any number of other unfounded beliefs that people adopt.
 ...and nonbelievers in evolution
 Should an article on NASA have a big section on UFOs and UFO abduction of farm animals?
 Why would you think otherwise?
 Among those with advanced training, I would expect this number to be far higher.

I am not going to carry on with this list. If this is the way to go about and insult/attack people in this ambiguous, indirect manner, I'd be glad to change to that way. It would be fun to attack people personally by implying things between the lines, like your buddy did (which you didn't warn). I am a very uncivil and aggressive person, so it would be fun to find alternative ways to personally attack those who do not directly insult me or my culture. Actually, I don't give a crap what you people at Wikipedia think.

You really do not understand:

1-The question is why the symbols must be removed from the infobox;

2-They MAY be still valid. What we have until now, and nobody can find more evidences, is that law of 1962; The last law that deals SPECIFICALLY with the topic is the one to be followed; It doesn´t matter if this law is from the time of Cleopatra. It doesn´t matter if it´s a colonial symbol.

3-There are many examples throughout history: New York city, Jakarta, São Paulo city, Rio de Janeiro city, and many other cities used their colonial symbols until a new law dealing with the subject was created. Some even maintained their colonial symbols, like New York and Rio. That´s a heraldry principle.

4-What we can do is to put a tag or something saying """"MAYBE STILL IN USE"""". If there is no newer law dealing with the symbols of Dili, YES THEY ARE VALID NOWADAYS, as strange as it can be.

5-If they belong to the colonial times, why we have a photo of 1991 with Ramos Horta holding the flag of an occupied territory, that is struggling with invasion and doesn´t want to be a colony again?  """,0

Thanks for reverting that back again. FYI I’ve not decided that all geographic articles should list any football clubs in the area in the lead section.

 Notification: changes to """"Mark my edits as minor by default"""" preference 

Hello there. This is an automated message to tell you about the gradual phasing out of the preference entitled """"Mark all edits minor by default"""", which you currently have (or very recently had) enabled.

On 13 March 2011, this preference was hidden from the user preferences screen as part of efforts to prevent its accidental misuse (consensus discussion, guidelines for use at WP:MINOR). This had the effect of locking users in to their existing preference, which, in your case, was true. To complete the process, your preference will automatically be changed to false in the next few days. This does not require any intervention on your part and all users will still be able to manually mark their edits as being minor in the usual way.

 Germany -  four entries 

You did not respond to my argument at all - please read it more carefully:

The IOC cannot be seen as the single authoritative source on this article, as the IOC itself does not publish all-time tables, and publishes only unofficial tables per single Games. Therefore this article is in violation with WP:No original research! The official source for the German National Olympic Committee (DOSB) does list the Olympic Medals for Germany from 1896 to 2012 → .

There were no official country codes before 1976: Only in 1976 did the IOC start to assign standardized codes. Before that time, the local Organizing Committees of each Olympic Games had chosen codes, often in the local language, resulting in a multitude of codes.

At the Games of 1956, 1960, and 1964 the German team was simply known as """"Germany"""" and the usual country code of (GER) was used. Yet, the IOC code EUA is currently applied in hindsight in the IOC medal database, without further explanation given. 

Yugoslavia does not exist anymore as a country - the FRG does. The (FRG) Federal Republic of Germany did not cease to exist. It was a simple code change, same country, same NOC. NO alternate NOCs: EUA, FRG and GER have always had the same German National Olympic Committee (NOC) recognized in 1895, same NOC President (Willi Daume, 1960–1993), same Olympic Committee located in Frankfurt - only the codes have changed. Germany is officially still called (FRG), the Federal Republic of Germany - it's the same country, with the same NOC since the first modern Games held in 1896 - only the GDR had a separate NOC, because it was a separate country (although not recognized by Germany). """"West Germany"""" did never exist, and is nothing more than the common English name used for the Federal Republic of Germany or FRG. The """"enlarged"""" Federal Republic of Germany (known simply as """"Germany"""") is thus the continuation of the pre-1990 Federal Republic of Germany - the very same country, with the same National Olympic Committee since 1895.

Boothy, as much difficulty as you and some of the other true believers seem to have with this concept, not everything is a matter of opinion, and not all opinions are equally valid. When I post to an article about the city of Chicago, I do so as somebody who actually does live here, has done so for a good long time, and knows the place firsthand - something that the idiots who did the reverts can't legitimately claim for themselves. You've offered a vague remark about how I have a problem with some of the editor's """"opinions""""; in true Usenet fashion, giving the spin while leaving out the awkward details.

The """"opinions"""" given are on such subjects as what the lowest reported temperature in Chicago was, whether or not cheese customarily appears on an Italian Beef sandwich, and other things which, like these, aren't a matter of guesswork, but of simple observation. One of the additions I made to the article which somebody, I believe yourself, wiped out with a revert mentioned the """"arctic express"""" winter of 1981-82. When one takes the already silly concept of NPOV, and exaggerates it to the point at which one wipes out mentions of actual historical events which one just doesn't happen to have been will informed enough about the subject to havew heard of, one has reached a level of lunacy unusual even by the standards of the Internet and postmodernism. I said this before and will stand by it - anybody who feels that the mention of an unusually cold winter is too much cointroversy for the site to handle obviously has issues that cry out for medication.

So let's not act like I was getting angry because one of the """"editors"""" (read: overly pushy posters) disagreed with me about what the best movie of May was, or anything of that sort, which is clearly the impression that you're trying to leave the reader with. My well-justified anger comes from the fact that somebody has used censorship in an attempt to conceal the fact that he didn't know what he was talking about when he wrote that article. I might say that same about the people who did the reverts, including, for example, somebody from """"Concordia"""", wherever that is - somewhere far enough from Chicago that most of us have never even heard of it. And yet this person feels qualified to vet additions to an article on Chicago.

That's messed up. - Joseph from Chicago""",0

"Reforming Wikipedia is an impossible feat, i fail to see positive improvement on articles. I find it remarkable that so many keep reverting so much. The ability for growth is stifled.

 Concerning point 1, Milburn is a student, by his own statement on his Wikipedia page, studying philosophy in Lancaster.

 Concerning your point 2, please read my talk page, and you will see that rather than insulting Milburn, I have just stated facts. Milburn has been writing to me that he is a """"dedicated"""" and """"experienced"""" editor. Why should this have been relevant to me? I had already told him, in no uncertain terms, that I had left the issue to Stifle to decide upon. Yet, Milbrun kept writing to me that while Stifle was an experienced editor, he was also experienced. All these, in the face of the fact that I had never said him anything to the contrary! I had just said that we, i.e. I and Milburn, disagreed on the issue of the photograph of Michael Foot and therefore it was best if the issue was dealt with by someone else. Why had I to be constantly told things that he kept telling me? Read his messages and count the number of times that he has written to me that I did not understand certain things! 

 What could possibly be wrong with being a student in Lancaster? In point of fact, University of Lancaster has one of the best, if not the best, laboratories of law-temperature physics world-wide. If there are ten great low-temperature physicists in the world, thee of them are in Lancaster (they have over long periods of time had the world records of lowest temperatures ever achieved in laboratory; they were the main figures behind the dilution refrigerator, etc.). No, you are utterly mistaken if you believe that I meant something negative by referring to University of Lancaster - some of my best and most respected colleagues are working there (I even was their guest sometimes ago), one of them also a mathematician of great international standing.

 I hope I have made it abundantly clear that there is nothing disrespectful in my writings about J. Milburn as a person, as well as about his contributions (I simply do not know his and his contributions). I just happened to disagree with him on his tagging this photograph for deletion. That is why I suggested to him, already yesterday, that rather than arguing, we left the matter to be decided on by Stifle. That is all, insofar as I am concerned. It is J.

 The Military history WikiProject Newsletter Issue I - March 2006  Project news
 An independent military history peer review has been created for the benefit of the project.  A number of articles have already been reviewed, receiving significantly more feedback within the project than they did on the generic peer review page.
 The project's Collaboration of the Fortnight got off to a great start with Ferdinand Foch and is now focusing on the military history of Spain.
 Two new task forces—dealing with warfare during classical antiquity and the Middle Ages—have been created.
 An effort to build a catalogue of high-quality maps for use in military history articles is now underway.
 The newly-formed translation department is looking for volunteers to help with translating featured articles from other-language Wikipedias. From the Coordinators
Welcome to the inaugural issue of the Military history WikiProject's newsletter!  We hope that this new format will help members—especially those who may be unable to keep up with some of the rapid developments that tend to occur—find new groups and programs within the project that they may wish to participate in.  

Please consider this inital issue to be a prototype; as always, any comments and suggestions are quite welcome, and will help us improve the newsletter in the coming months.

 Proposed guidelines for categories of military people are currently being discussed.  A number of issues have already been resolved, but the proposed scheme is still in draft form and further input would be very welcome.

"anthropomorphic bias ==

There appears to be some sensitivity with respect to this topic, which I think is due to an anthropomorphic bias.  Dysgenics is a research topic in biology; the anthropological and sociocultural aspects are not central to the topic.  The concerns listed in the heading paragraph belong lower in the text, as they apply only to the aspect of the term relating to homo sapiens.  

(and I want to add)

The concept of dysgenics itself is really only at home in a discussion of genotype.  Direct anthropomorphic considerations (of the sociopolitical aspects outlined in the article) are very crude constructions which do not hew to the precise biological use of the term.  I think one danger is that, by focusing on the easily politicized extension of the term, we risk conflating an important biological concept with indirect sociological constructions.  Next thing you know, biologists innocently researching fruit flies get implicated in fascism, eugenics, and gas chambers.  So I agree that we need to make very careful use of these terms.  These concepts, while connected to a degree, should be covered carefully. 137.186.41.143

 Items Not Yet Ready For Prime-Time Scholarly Review on Wikiversity 

As you may know, KillerChihuahau summarily baleeted these essays from the pages of Wikiversity, presumably because she disagrees with the notion of using the donor-funded site to educate 21st Century youth in modern concepts of ethical organizational management. Moulton 

 Abolishing the Wikipedia Bans As a Governance Tool 
The following article originally appeared as an add-on comment in the P2P Foundation's blog. Michael Bauwens, the editor of the site, elevated the comment to a main article in its own right.
The governance model of Wikipedia was so anachronistic that it took me over a year to place it in the timeline of historic governance models adopted at various times in the annals of human history.

The thing that stymied me was the prominence of blocking and banning as the primary tool of governance. I simply couldn’t place that among the recognized tools of governance in any historic context.

And then I happened to take a look at the oldest surviving account of secular law — the Code of Hammurabi of 1760 BC.

Of the 282 laws that Hammurabi of Mesopotamia carved into the stone tablets, take note of the very first one:
1. If any one ensnare another, putting a ban upon him, but he can not prove it, then he that ensnared him shall be put to death.
Evidently, banning (ostracism) was a common practice in the tribal cultures in the Middle East some 4000 years ago, at the dawn of civilization. Capricious and spurious banning was evidently such a common and egregious abuse of tribal overlords that Hammurabi made it a capital offense to ban someone without proving just cause.

And yet, on Wikipedia, indefinite blocks and bans without due process are a common occurrence. That is to say, the prevailing governance model of Wikipedia corresponds to a pre-Hammurabic tribal ochlocracy that is so anachronistic, it predates the advent of the Rule of Law.

When Thomas Jefferson and the other Founders drafted the US Constitution, one of the provisions they put in Article One was a prohibition against Bills of Attainder. A Bill of Attainder is the technical term in the law for declaring a person to be an outlaw (without respect to having violated any specific law that applies equally to everyone). The Founders excluded Bills of Attainder from the tools of governance because 4000 years of political history had demonstrated that such a toxic practice is corrosive and ridden with corruption, and invariably sinks any government that comes to rely on it.

The irony here is that Wikipedia purports to be the “sum of all knowledge” with an educational mission that reaches out to students, teachers, and scholars around the world. And yet those exercising power in Wikipedia have not yet learned the oldest and most profound lessons in the annals of human history — lessons enshrined in the first written law and in the first article of the US Constitution.

The consequence of adopting such an anachronistic governance model is that Wikipedians are fated to relive and reify the long-forgotten lessons of history. They relive those lessons by reprising the same kind of political dramas that fill the history books since the dawn of civilization.

The anachronistic governance model which Jimbo Wales foolishly and mindlessly introjected into Wikipedia is simply not a sustainable model in this day and age. Summary and capricious banning wasn’t even a sustainable model some 3768 years ago when Hammurabi first singled it out as an unacceptable practice in a civilized culture.

So what to do about it? The answer can be found in the second law of Hammurabi’s Code. As Hammurabi advises, the solution is to tell them to go jump in the lake.

Or as they say in Yiddish, “Nem zich a vaneh!“

Ok, I've looked at Hanged, drawn and quartered (ugh!), and  similarly pointed me to Marco Polo, and I think I'm getting it now - bear with me, my head's been this shape for a long time now! That is, I can see that one could feel a bit overwhelmed by some of the refs in Reculver, as there's so much in them. That's something that I'm used to and comfortable with, but I suppose the point is that it could be well outside many readers' comfort zones? So, I think I'm convinced. Which means that now, it's me that's intimidated - by the coding I'll have to learn, and the scale of the task! I think this is partly why I let it slide, when Chzz first suggested it. To be honest, I think I feel a little like MF these days - though I have put a lot of effort into some articles in the past, I've wanted to back away from the friction that often arises in WP; but sometimes I'll still get involved - popping up here asking for help with Reculver was spurred by an accidental urge to buff up Walkington Wold burials, which came over me only in the last couple of days - and so I'd like to use that to get obscure, remote, yet historically fascinating Reculver up to GA, in case I never feel the urge again.
In view of which, I think I'll tinker with the """"tentative experiment"""" in the Reculver article in the next day or two, to straighten it out, and to explore what needs to be done. While I'm here, though, is there a citation template that renders a bibliography entry in a format like """"Bloggs, J., Going for GA, Oxbridge, 2011.""""? Or """"Bloggs, J., """"How to do it"""", in Joseph, B. (ed.), It's Like This, Oxbridge, 2011, pp. 1-100.""""? I haven't seen one. Or would there be no need to use a citation template at all, even?

"Yes, being paid alters judgement. So does joining Scientology, believing in Astrology, being against gun control, being for gun control, or any number of other reasons for advocacy editing. I could make a case for Wikipedia being harmed more by religious or political advocacy editing than by paid advocacy editing (but see below for why I think this might change).
There are however, a couple of things that are special about paid advocacy editing which IMO require extra care.
First, Scientology cannot do anything to suddenly have ten times more followers. They are already doing the best they can and the pool of potential converts is resistant.
Paid advocacy editing, on the other hand, can easily gain as many paid advocacy editors as desired by simply paying more. Think of the difference between getting emails advocating politics or religion vs. emails about online pharmacies. The first is annoying, but self limiting; the second gets bigger and bigger as long as it remains profitable. Our article on Email spam gives numbers like 200 billion spam messages sent per day and 97% of all emails being unwanted. I think Jimbo is right to be especially concerned over something that could grow exponentially.
Second, we really cannot do anything to convince most religion or politics advocates to change their ways other than blocking or banning them, but we can make big changes in how paid advocacy editors operate. If it becomes well known that the advocacy editors who don't edit articles directly but instead make talk page requests get better results and that the sneaky kind of paid advocacy editor usually gets reverted, the customers will naturally go with the service that gets the best results. We can make that happen, but again it takes special care.",0

Is your opinion that this is an """"uninteresting semantic point"""" as an expert in semantics or as an expert in Catholic theology? I ask because in English """"dissent"""" and """"criticism"""" while closely related are not synonyms, and in Catholic theology """"dissent"""" is a term of art that describes rejection of a binding teaching. A Catholic is free to drive an SUV, support a war, or support the death penalty because there is no binding teaching forbidding any of them, even though one or more Popes have taken personal positions opposing them. E.g.:

https://www.ewtn.com/library/CURIA/cdfworthycom.HTM

""""While the Church exhorts civil authorities to seek peace, not war, and to exercise discretion and mercy in imposing punishment on criminals, it may still be permissible to take up arms to repel an aggressor or to have recourse to capital punishment. There may be a legitimate diversity of opinion even among Catholics about waging war and applying the death penalty, but not however with regard to abortion and euthanasia.""""

2. Shoplifter has been here forever with no complaints. The one I saw recently was """"Surely not Shoplifter"""" so they removed it based on opinion.

====Alfrem banned from Libertarianism====
Enacted on 19:58, July 13, 2005 (UTC)  

 Pending resolution of this matter  is banned from editing of Libertarianism. It shall be presumed that any user, such as  who makes Alfrem's trademark edit, removal of the phrase """"Libertarianism is a political philosophy,"""" from the article is a sockpuppet of Alfrem. Such sockpuppets may be banned indefinitely if practical.

According to this, it seems like  should be banned indefinitely if practical...   

Are you the Great Dictator?  

No.  Just extraplating from what was said about you earlier.  And, by the way, there is nothing unlibertarian about banning someone from a libertarian community who cannot abide by the rules designed to protect everyone's rights within that community.   For example, being refused entrance to a tie-required restaurant - for lack of wearing a tie - is consistent with libertarianism.   

 about me? Denunciation! Not even your term of sockpuppet is correct. And, by the way, you describe Wikipedia as your property but it is used as political public good.  

When you can spare 5 free min. within your dictatorship, you may deliver about the old question:
What is your concrete evidence that libertarianism must be described in its characteristic feature as """"political""""?
 

What would be an example if such evidence, if it were possible? You've already dismissed appeals to logic, highlighting of the prima facie indefinsibility of your position, and links from across pretty much the entirety of Western civilization. You don't even understand half of what is said here. Do you want a photograph? A mathematical proof? You made up your mind along time ago and won't listen to any other opinions. Now, are you Alfrem or not?  █♣█ ▪ Talk 

Yes, I am convinced that Irgendwer is Alfrem. They are both German, and they use similar mannerisms such as referring to libertarianism as """"L."""", """"kindergarten"""", etc. They make similar grammatical errors.

It is essential that the Able Danger debate be carried out in the places where it is relevant.  It is simply not relevant here.  If you can find legitimate news sources or counterterrorism analysts who provide a justification for its relevance here then it will be worth considering but right now it has no relevance whatsoever.  Your speculation about the credibility of the 9/11 Commission on issues not addressed by Able Danger is just pure speculation.  From someone, I might add, whose own credibility is very much in question.  I will continue to delete references to Able Danger until someone establishes their relevance in a meaningful way, not through a string of random speculations barely tied together by a thread like the above.  And again, let us please remember that the 9/11 Commission is not the issue here anyway.  The commission is cited but the pieces of evidence they look at are all pieces of intelligence brought out by other agencies.  As for the arrest of Iraqis in Germany, again, if you find evidence or even authoritative speculation tying those arrests to Able Danger we can consider it - otherwise it is just a string of increasingly bankrupt attempts at pseudo-logic. 05:11",0

"Protected Mode and Long Mode 

Protected Mode was first introduced in Intel 80286, providing mechanism protecting resource and assisting multi-task OS such as UNIX, OS/2 and so forth, and enhanced in Intel 80386 processor by extending computing capability to 32 bits from 16 bits, eventually becomes part of IA-32 architecture. Most x86 OS only running within protectected mode such as Windows NT, Linux, and so many BSD distros; but MS-DOS working under real mode, some extender might switch through and back from protected mode for extending physical memory addressing, likewise, Windows 3.x also transit itself from real mode and protected mode thorugh and ack too. Windows 9x not only depends the real mode as bootstrap, but also sits itself from and to that mode. 

Long Mode is a kind of protected mode, not a real mode, but does not belong to the Protected Mode in IA-32, switches itself out of IA-32 dominated Legacy Mode, to a completely self-contained mode, which means even though a x64 processor eliminates its legacy part, it would be fulfunctioned. From the aspect of implementation, or Microarchitecture level, the legacy mode codes could share the same physical execution resources designed for the x64 codes, without needing additional physical execution units for itself, like it found in early Itanium processor. So IA-32 architecture might or might not have relationship with x86-64, x64, AMD64 or Intel64. 

 IA32e and AMD64 

AMD64 is a switched-out architecture from IA-32, providing compatibility mode to support most IA-32 software and representing itself in the Long Mode within AMD64 processors. It is a new architecture, even though most lying on IA-32 architecture. 

IA32e is not a mode, but an extention of IA-32, or newer revision of IA-32, introducing 64-bit computing capability for its fundemental architecture. Intel EM64T is the new brought feature to this kind of processors, enabling it for 64-bit computing. Of course, EM64T is not a mode too, but a feature like PAE, could be enabled to extend the 64-bit computing capability. Without EM64T enabled, Yamhill processor would act like a tradtional Pentium 4. 

After EM64T enabled, 64-bit registers would be visible to applications. 32-bit traditional OS might need minor fixes to support applications referring 64-bit registers to do the 64-bit computings, but programmers must take care of the computing results without intervented by other processes. But most likely as it in PAE, OS might need a patch to support this feature totally, at least to manage the extended descriptors and extended 64-bit registers and stacks and so forth, but without needing to compile the OS from the scratch like it in AMD64. Virtual Address might be extended up to 52 bits, while physical address up to 46 bits. 16K segments of 4GiB could be spreaded to 64TiB physical space, with or without paging. Because the difference between 32bit and 64bit computing is bit width of register rather than the whole system, so 32-bit and 64-bit codes is also differentiated by the referenced resgistered without needing a submode, such as compatibility mode to support tradtional 32-bit software. 

After EM64T disabled, Yamhill processor would act like a Northwood Pentium 4.",0

grant hill?  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 82.109.90.183   

Magic is the best example of a Point-Forward.  He's the guy on the floor that could play all positions and still run the offense.  LeBron James, Grant Hill, Lamar Odom, Antoine Walker are all guys in the league that are point forwards.  Shawn Marion and Dirk Nowitzki could also be considered point-forwards.  Kevin Durant and Brandon Roy could develop into point-forwards.  It could be argued Charles Barkley and Michael Jordan had some point-forward skill, both of them running their teams during crunch time, although Jordan will be remembered as the ultimate swingman, which he clearly was, than as a point-forward which he was when he began his career and later became again with the Wizards.  Magic gave us """"showtime"""" though, he made the position what it is.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 72.129.10.77   

Dirk Nowitzki and Shawn Marion point forwards? That's just incorrect. Anthony Mason was a great passing power forward, not a point forward.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 62.107.216.70   

WHAT ABOUT POINT CENTER

I would like to see some information about the Point center position. Certain centers have the offense go through them similar to point forwards.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 206.246.140.166   

Define """"having the offense go through them"""" for point centers...there are some great passing centers, who the offense moves through (Shaq, Bogut, Duncan), but I can't think of any center who regularly brings the ball up and runs the perimeter game, which is the essence of a point. Also, Magic should NOT be listed as a point forward.  He is a big point guard, and played as a big point guard. and guarded other point guards.    The Showtime Lakers has Michael Cooper, James Worthy, and Byron Scott starting at shooting guard and small forward, putting Magic at point guard.  Most other point forwards (particularly Pippen and anyone who would qualify in today's game) still have actual point guards on the floor with them, though the ball handling is reduced and they're often combo guards(think Ron Harper, Boobie Gibson, Delonte West).  So Magic is still a PG, despite his height, and not a point forward.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 68.35.243.11

So you are saying that the first Kingdom of Israel (1020–931 B.C.), Northern Kingdom of Israel (931–722 B.C.), the Kingdom of Judah (931–586 B.C.), the Hasmonean/Maccabee religious Jewish religious kingdom (140–37 B.C.), the region of Judea, and the Roman province of Judaea never existed? Interesting how Arabs can several centuries later invade Judea in the seventh century A.D. and somehow become indigenous.

Here are the origins for the name of the so-called """"Palestinians"""": H.H. Ben-Sasson, A History of the Jewish People, Harvard University Press, 1976, ISBN 0-674-39731-2, page 334: """"In an effort to wipe out all memory of the bond between the Jews and the land, Hadrian changed the name of the province from Iudaea to Syria-Palestina, a name that became common in non-Jewish literature.""""

This describes how the so-called """"Palestinian"""" Arabs invaded from Mecca and elsewhere in the Arabian peninsula and conquered Judea from the Byzantines (Greek Romans), who in turn had conquered the land from the Jews: Gil, Moshe; Ethel Broido (1997). A History of Palestine. Cambridge University Press, pp. 634–1099. ISBN 978-0-521-59984-9.

Clearly, the references cited by the Arabs on this page are inaccurate and not reliable. If indigenous peoples are the first known inhabitants of a land, then """"Palestinian"""" Arabs are clearly not indigenous to Israel, unless the authors of the cited works are applying to """"indigenous"""" a completely different and non-standard meaning.""",0

"Composition of the list (table) 

1. Removed the info on Falcon X Heavy and Falcon XX, since those are just proposed concepts that haven't yet reached nowhere near the project stage. 2. Removed the info stating that Saturn INT-21 had one launch. It has never flown, the booster used for Skylab was an actual Saturn V with the 3rd stage modified into Skylab itself. The entry for Saturn INT-21 should probably be deleted altogether, but unlike two heavy Falcons it was under development coming much closer to becoming an operational vehicle, so I'm not sure. 3. Added clarification to Space Shuttle entry that it is regarded here as an integrated launch system, and not a standalone heavy booster, also removed the note stating:  'Like Soviet Energia-Buran system, despite of integrated design of rocket and orbiter, US Space Shuttle may be comparatively considered as launcher for such superheavy payload as manned spaceplane. But it should be noted that the orbiter could not hold more tha 25,000 kg.'  Such reasoning is not entirely justified. It can be considered as such only with serious reservations, since Shuttle's Orbiter acts de facto as a returnable third stage which cannot be replaced with anything else and has to be brought back to Earth, whereas other boosters can hypothetically (or practically, like Saturn V - Skylab case) have the load they put in LEO modified.  And certainly the Shuttle system cannot be part of this comparative list based on similarity with Energia-Buran (the note says 'like Soviet Energia-Buran system') since Enegia booster could be adapted to carry basically any appropriately configured and balanced payload piggybacked on its side, not just the orbiter.",0

 First Time User 

Hi, Lightdarkness. I am not quite sure how to categorize the photo of the Orange Bowl I uploaded. I took the photo on vacation a couple of weeks ago, so I guess it is mine. I would like it to be shared by the Wikipedia community (GDFL), but I'm not sure how to categorize it. Also, I successfully uploaded it to the Orange Bowl Stadium page, but didn't save it because I didn't want to butcher the look of the page. I'm still in the trial and error stage.

Any advice you have would be helpful.

Haaron755

 Running Late 

Thanks for the advice, LD. I am running a little late and have to go to work, so when I get home tonight I will attempt to follow the instructions you've laid out. As far as the Orange Bowl page is concerned, I was able to upload the photo to the page without making the page look rediculous. I went to another wiki page, copied the edit code they used, and applied it to Orange Bowl. Worked like a charm.

I am a HUGE wiki fan and have a ton of photos to contribute from my travels. Hopefully you can keep an eye on me and walk me through any more problems should they arise.

Thanks again.

You are very much right, when the IP is blocked my user account is blocked as well. I wasn't around for this 15 minutes, I guess. But I've been blocked about 5 or 6 times since January because of this anon vandal. Not sure what I can do, except e-mail the blocker every time this happens again.

So kate's machine-readable tool has been queried quite a lot the past few days (2664 times on Feb 25th)...  is this caused by your bot, or did you do the much more reasonable thing as I suggested, and bugged a toolserver person to generate a quick SQL query that would give you all this data with minimal bandwidth and minimal hassle?   
 You're just updating the list for a few people then, not for every user with 2500+ edits?

"I was requested to provide an opinion here by ComfyKem. Everyone agrees that virus species and genera are inherently different. Usual practice for a genus with a single species would be to construct a single article to cover both, and that's sensible where the pair would otherwise duplicate each other. However, there's no reason in principle why each can't have an article  as long as there is sufficient distinctive, reliably sourced material in each to merit that. This appears to be the case here, just about (though bloating the Lloviu virus article with speculative information about what the virus particle might look like appears unhelpful). If we are to have a single article on a genus with a single species, as Plantdrew suggests, it would probably be best to have it at the species name, as that is what the bulk of readers are most likely to search for.",0

"""

I've got to say, I've read you """"pacafistic"""" rules, seen your idea of """"logic"""", and have heard tales of your """"justification"""" and I just have to say:

I have this to say on my behavior:
I'm a perfectly reasonable person when it comes to arguements, even when they are against my favor. I change subjects, help the people with simple little details they might have gotten wrong, ask them for proper information that I might use against them, basically anything a scatter brainer would do.

I let people have their ways for a little while just to experiment with how it turns out, I try to help BOTH OF US come out on top, I treat both equelly, and I don't get angry when someone yells in my face.

Why should I? They are angry first so I know they are suffering enough and would only poke at them some more just to annoy them (sound fimiliar?) I give them their space though I would still do what I did/do to annoy them. Except, I do it without coming into contact with them (as they would do to me) which I know we'd both appreciate.

I keep the sitch isolated someone else doesn'tblow the entire thing out of proportion before me and that person can resolve the matter only with each other which is inevitable. Others can't resolve the problem, only make it bigger and more serious for either 1 or both. see below.

If they ever try to apologize I tell them not to→ because I wouldn't→ because I have no reason to→ because we shouldn't have been in a scrabble no if ands or buts about it. Conflict is stupid. Almost (but not quite) as stupid as the species that create/embrace it. Leave the creatures space to realize this and you will have peace once more until the next pointless bicker and inevitable resolve.

Now, I have this to say about the """"good"""" people of wikipedia:
Wow.
There sure aren't a lot of you. I wonder why... You've seen many cases and classes of human behavior and traits, you (think) you know what to expect. Well you have most of it down. But you went wrong at a few turns:
1. You (blindly) follow invalid rules and principles that completely misinterpret the act and are constantly showing how much shit they're full of.

2. You think you got """"human psychology"""" in the bag and have tried to play from this to class your principles into rules but your system is far outdated and very inhumane.

3. You don't want to and try not to link yourselves and articles with POV(point of views) but little have you realized your entire system thrives apon it. 
You take sides in arguments between users based solely on what YOU think is most right based apon how YOU have been taught what is right. You are NO ONE to interpret what """"mad"""", """"kind"""", """"eccentric"""", ect. is. Just another group of the bunch and they all think seperately on subjects or else we'd look and be exactly the same. And you don't want that.

We all want what we shouldn't have. 
Unfortunately, there are some of us who already have what we shouldn't have.

5. How you go about it is the wrong way. 
Some things people must learn for themselves. You have a problem, try relying on yourself and no one else to resolve.  
If some people are fighting with each other over the internet just sit back and let them/butt out and leave them to their bickering. Sooner or later they will stop arguing of their own account/or reasoning. Or they may even just """"stop"""".

I've added this, see Cat#Skin Think outside the box 

 Scientific classification 

It appears that the current use of F. silvestris catus as the main scientific name is the result of a somewhat misguided interpretation of developments in taxonomy. I propose it is changed back to F. catus. First, this is a continuation of a lot of past discussion; most recently:
/Archive 8#Species name, and
/Archive 8#Scientific name
This discussion seems to have petered out into inactivity. It was noted that publications had started using silvestris catus, but no such citations were given. The article in its current state (under #Scientific classification) cites ICZN opinion 2027. However, as was noted in the prior discussion, this is a misinterpretation of the ruling, which was specifically aimed at wild animals and did not affect domestic animals; see this note, specifically reading from """"This erroneous nomenclature"""" and the preceding paragraphs. ITIS was also cited in discussion. This clearly prefers catus as the conventional name, although it cites MWS in noting that silvestris is also a synonym.

It would therefore be much more NPOV to acknowledge F. catus as the usual name. If catus and silvestris are indeed the same species then this should be discussed under #Scientific classification. Currently, this section should have {{disputed-section|Scientific classification}} put on it, because its interpretation of the source is wrong. I would do this, but I'm a new user, so semi-protection is stopping me. It would be even better if somebody can provide a source explaining the equivalence; all the most cited, most reliable sources in this discussion so far have favoured F. catus.

Also, while this is still semi-protected, I'd like to point out that both inline citations of Mammal Species of the World should be removed. The first is uncalled for by WP:LEAD#Citations. The name """"cat"""" is common knowledge and is recognised by all 62 other references in the article body. The second deals with specific species names for cat breeds. MSW doesn't even mention these names, so it's unfair to synthesise from that that Wozencraft, let alone all feline biologists, does not support them. However, MSW is a useful reference, so I suggest moving the citation to external links, or a probably-needed """"Further reading"""" section.   
Works for me. My opinion last time was that we should go with whatever the reliable sources say and F. catus is now the accepted name, then so be it. ''''  {chat} 
MSW3 is the canonical listing of mammalian taxonomy. It uses Felis catus and notes there is some controversy. We should do the same. -  (talk) 
I view this with suspicion. If 's interpretation is true, then ITIS should not report the domestic dog as Canis lupus familiaris, and call Canis familiaris invalid. The ITIS webpage has no entry at all for Felis silvestris catus, not even to call it invalid. Felis silvestris catus is used more and more frequently in the scientific literature. I draw this from scholar.google.com: 
From 1982-1991, 0 uses of Felis silvestris catus, many uses of Felis silvestris f catus'' whatever that notation means.

"Thanks to all for taking my rather offhand comment seriously.  To reiterate my original explanatoin to James: I'm interested in this more on a meta level (how do we approach controversial subjects) than out of deep feelings one way or the other towards Moore and his film; that is, I'm trying to see the forest of making a good article on the film rather than the trees of every factual detail within the film that contributors might have multiple viewpoints about.  For an encyclopedia based around the concept of a Neutral Point of View, any attempt to either counter or defend the content of a subject that is, in itself, an editorial statment seems wrong; such discussions wind up as parasites draining the life and meaning out of an otherwise useful article.  See, for example, something like Roe v. Wade  there's no need to use that article to debate all the pros and cons of the subject involved  there are other articles for that linked at the bottom  just state the facts about the case.  Even if you really consider Moore's movie to be completely indefinsible propaganda (and to risk the Wiki-equivalent of Godwin's Law here), note that the article on Triumph of the Will doesn't feel the need to explain all the reasons why Nazi Germany wasn't all it was cracked up to be.

"By going through the websites I was capable of establishing a final evaluation for all the websites. I noticed that all four of the websites have a dark background (dark gray) and a light font on the writing (white). This makes it easier and clearer for people to read. Also, enlargement of the font would have made it more improved. In my opinion, leaving the whole text in all the websites in a normal font and not an italic font would be much more readable particularly to old people, and people who have sight problems. In addition, while looking into the data in the websites, you can clearly notice the politeness of the text which makes the websites suitable for people from all age groups. From searching the websites, I have observed the fact that there are completely no advertisements or commercials which help the reader to realize that the websites are reliable. Hence, some of the data entered in the websites are taken from unfair sources. For example, Graham Browely is the ex manager of the band, thus, he is expected not to be supporting the band and imply negative points concerning their new album. Also, Mike Jones is the current manager of the band; it is predictable of him to pronounce all the positive points about the band for the sake of advertising their new album. All websites are provided with quotations that are told by important people. It is essential for people who are interested in the subjects of the websites to also be interested in what important people have to say about the issue. This helps provide people with what they are looking for. I could not help but notice the link added on the end of the page in Mike Jones’ website which works perfectly well. This link is helpful for all people who are fans of Mike Jones and it leads them directly to his personal profile. Graham and Mike Jones’ websites show the date. It is apparent that Mike Jones’ website is more up to date than Graham’s. It is essential for a website to be up to date to stay interesting for the people viewing it.

 All positive points, no negatives mentioned AT ALL... 

This article reads more like a propaganda page than impartial information. It is probably written and maintained by a member of staff at the school, but even so it should give a neutral point of view. For example, the old fashioned grammar school attitudes that the school desperately hangs on to (these include uniforms that haven't changed at all since the 1950's, authoritarian attitudes that are concerned by uniform more than actually making sure the children get a good education, etc, etc...) cause tension between students and teachers, as these obviously dubious values do not fit well into modern society. Just to add to this, the most recent ofstead report strongly emphasises the need for student and teacher relationships to improve. however, because of the senior staff all living in the 1930's, they took this to mean they need to enforce the rules more, with stronger emphasis on uniform and weaker emphasis on educational support; this has simply degraded student's relationships with their teachers (especially the so - called """"senior staff"""" who don't even teach but instead spend their time punishing people for petty things - the school even employs a certain member of staff whose job it is to be horrible - ironically she is actually called Mrs Horride!) even further.

 Removed text from article 
You're right the history section needs serious work.  I have removed it from the article because, I believe, it is a lot of conjecture.  It certainly doesn't jive with what I've read on the subject, and goes contrary to information found in referenced articles, for example country dance originating in frontier towns.  I would suggest that the country dance section of the folk dance article is read carefully.  

I would also suggest that careful citing of references in this history section will make it a lot better.  What happened to the role of the """"dance master"""", and of """"recorded music""""?  These are both important aspects of the caller's history.

It's a little too hit-and-miss for my taste.   

History
The role of the dance caller or cuer came out of necessity, given the origins of folk dance in America, but also in various cultures throughout the world.

In America, you can find many examples throughout history of frontier towns (where country dance originated) having people with traditions and dance styles from all over the world.  It was customary for people, when they finished work for the day, or when the week was over, to relax and go to a community dance event.  Everyone from town came.

Having people, however, from all sorts of different cultures caused problems.  People from one culture would know a certain type of music, or certain steps; and while there was some overlap in a few cases, the different steps were very confusing to those who didn't know the dances.  Also confusing was the fact that even in the case of overlap between cultures, the steps had differing names.

Thus, the country dance caller was created out of necessity.  Rather than only the dances they knew from each caller, someone was called upon (or more often just came about in an effort to help everyone have a good time) who learned the dances and steps of everyone, and each town created their own list of dance steps.

As towns expanded, and people travelled, these new callers (named such because they called out what you were to do next in each dance) were able to learn from each other and each other's styles to the point where, modernly, there is a full Callerlab devoted to maintaining a list of proper square dance calls, integrating new calls and styles of dance, and generally supporting and promoting new ideas in square dance calling, as well as up-and-coming callers.""",0

I also disputed the use of the term """"sharing,"""" which is a misnomer. Sharing is a computer concept whereby a network of computers share access so that computer A can access a file on computer B, but the file remains resident on computer B. Copying is a simple concept whereby the file on computer B is copied to computer B. Napster was designed to facilitate copying, but the proponents of Napster called it """"sharing"""" for propaganda purposes, since the unauthorized copying of a copyrighted work is a civil and criminal offense and morally wrong. """"Sharing"""" sounds like something your elementary school teacher wanted you to do. If you share a sandwich, the other person eats half of your sandwich. If you log onto a so-called """"file-sharing"""" system, the other person copies your song, but you keep your copy, too. The Courts held that Napster was a giant copyright infringement. However, it was very popular and still has many proponents on Widipedia, who still insist on calling it """"sharing"""" and don't want the fact that their """"sharing"""" wiped out the music industry (and a lot of recording arists with it), because that makes them immoral people.

Ruslik0 is incorrect in his block of me. I wasn't edit waring as defined by Wikipedia: I made one reversion of an edit today.

Furthermore, Ruslik0 is incorrect that I made a false accusation regarding the objective fact that Jeffro77 is engaging in vandalism: Jeffro77 replaced this entrywhich is very similar to the version that existed there since October 31, 2008, with some improvementswith this entry, giving the excuse in his edit summary of """"WP:FRINGE,"""" which doesn't even make sense as an explanation for his edits: i.e., deletion of a number of citations; deletion of the information on theologian Prof. Wolfhart Pannenberg's defense of the theology of the Omega Point Theory; etc. As well, there's no need for the large displayed quote, as the previous entry already stated that Prof. David Deutsch doesn't agree that the Omega Point is God; furthermore, Jeffro77's edit deletes the mention of the fact that Prof. Deutsch endorses the physics of the Omega Point Theory.

In addtion, Jeffro77's edit isn't even literate, as he give the following mangled citation to Prof. Deutsch: """"Chapter 14: """"The Ends of the Universe,"""" with additional comments by Frank J. Tipler; also available here"""". Whereas the version before was properly cited: """"David Deutsch, The Fabric of Reality: The Science of Parallel Universes—and Its Implications (London: Allen Lane The Penguin Press, 1997), ISBN 0713990619. Extracts from Chapter 14: """"The Ends of the Universe,"""" with additional comments by Frank J. Tipler; also available here and here.""""

As stated above, Jeffro77's excuse in his edit summary doesn't even make sense, as it doesn't explain why he would delete mention of Prof. Deutsch's endorsement of the physics of the Omega Point Theory, particularly since Jeffro77 himself called Deutsch an """"eminent physicist"""" in his own edit (i.e., that statement wasn't there before): of which argues against the notion that Jeffro77 considers the physics of the Omega Point Theory as fringe. Further, Jeffro77 deleted mention of the fact that Prof. Wolfhart Pannenberg, who is one of the leading theologians in the world, has defended the theology of the Omega Point Theory and Tipler's position that the Omega Point is consistent with the Judeo-Christian God.

Additionally, while Jeffro77's """"fringe"""" claim's aren't even relevant to his edit, they have already been refuted numerous times. Indeed, Jeffro77 himself refutes this claim in this very edit of his: to state again, therein Jeffro77 himself called Prof. Deutsch an """"eminent physicist"""" in his own words. So obviously Jeffro77 himself must consider Deutsch's endorsement of the physics of the Omega Point Theory to be noteworthy, and yet he deleted this endoresement in an area where Jeffro77 himself agrees that Deutsch is eminently qualified and replaced it with a large displayed quotation regarding a matter that Deutsch has no qualification or erudition in, even though the previous version already clearly mentioned that Deutsch disagrees that Omega Point is God. Moreover, in this edit Jeffro77 deletes all mention of the fact that an actual trained theologian, Prof. Wolfhart Pannenberg, who is one of the world's leading theologians, has defended the theology of the Omega Point Theory.

As well, Prof. Tipler himself has defended the theology of the Omega Point Theory and his identification of the Omega Point as being God in a peer-reviewed academic journal: see Frank J. Tipler, """"The Omega Point as Eschaton: Answers to Pannenberg's Questions for Scientists,"""" Zygon: Journal of Religion & Science, Vol. 24, Issue 2 (June 1989), pp. 217-253. Regarding the physics, Prof. Tipler has published his Omega Point Theory in many peer-reviewed science journals, including a number of the leading physics journals such as Reports on Progress in Physics (one of the world's leading physics journals) and Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society (one of the world's leading astrophysics journals). The Wikipedia article on the Omega Point Theory lists seven different mainstream peer-reviewed scientific journals in which Tipler's Omega Point Theory has been published (and that's not including the Zygon journal). That is quite a significant amount.

"""==Translation issues==
In the original German was a sentence, """"Vor dem Dalang liegt auch kein Bananenstrunk, der die Puppen aufnimmt, sondern ein Plangkan (eine Art Tisch mit Löchern in der Tischplatte), auf dem die benötigten Puppen bereit gestellt werden.""""

I am changing this to simply , """"In front of the Dalang is a Plangkan (a type of table with holes punched in its surface), on which the necessary puppets sit ready for use. 

I think (but am not certain) that the that the untranslated part is more or less a joke: roughly, that there what is on the table is not a foo foo drink for the puppets. If anyone with better German than me thinks I'm wrong and there is something more substantial here, please restore the appropriate phrase. Thanks.

 

Another sentence with which I had trouble: Die Figuren dieser Schattenspiele waren Wayang Golek (normale Kopfgestalt durch einen da-mit verbundenen Stab auf dem Rumpf drehbar. Arme durch je ein Stab, der an der Hand befestigt ist beweglich) , geschnitzte, bemalte und bekleidete Figuren, die an Fäden gezogen wurden, Malereien auf Schautafeln oder geweihte und verkleidete Menschen.

I've rendered this """"The figures in these puppet plays were wayang golek (normally a head assembly connected by a straight stick to a trunk, allowing the head to swivel. Arms were attached to a separate staff, allowing hand motions), carved, painted and dressed figures, manipulated via threads or strings, painted dioramas or sanctified and dressed humans,"""" but that may not be quite right. If you know better, please correct the article (and make a note here that you've done so).   18:03, 1 Jun 2004 (UTC)

Your translation seems OK. Geweihte could also mean """"horned"""", which would make sense in the case of demons. """"Sanctified"""", as in """"blessed"""", makes less sense in the context.  12:44, 5 Jun 2004 (UTC)

Another tricky one: Wayang-Klitik-Figuren meist erheblich beschädigt, sehr zum Gaudium der Zuschauer..."""" I haven't even ventured a translation for this, it has several words I don't properly know. Is Gaudium perhaps the Latin word, as in """"gaudeamus igitur""""?   18:03, 1 Jun 2004 (UTC)  This has now been satisfactorily rendered.   05:40, Jun 5, 2004 (UTC)

Another problematic sentence: Aus diesem Grunde haben Wayang-Klitik-Figuren, die zu Spielen herangezogen werden und dort Kampfszenen zu durchstehen haben, Arme aus Leder. I currently have this partially translated as """"On this basis the wayang klitik figures have, die zu Spielen herangezogen werden and where battle scenes zu durchstehen haben, leather arms."""" I know that durchstehen is to stand one's ground, but I still can't fully translate the sentence.   18:17, 1 Jun 2004 (UTC)  This has now been satisfactorily rendered.   05:40, Jun 5, 2004 (UTC)

And another: Aus Jenggala und Kediri stammen die Geschichten von Raden Panji und Cindelaras, die ein paar Dorfjungen mit ihren Kampfhähnen erleben. The first part is """"From Jenggala and Kediri come the stories of Raden Panji and Cindelara,"""" I'm not at all clear on the latter part. My dictionary says Kampfhähnen are literally fighting cocks, but can just be pugnacious people.   19:46, 1 Jun 2004 (UTC)
 Someone else has now simply rendered this as fighting cocks, but I'd consider that suspect (since one can't tell from the original German). I'd like to find a more primary source before considering this necessarily correct.   05:40, Jun 5, 2004 (UTC)
 I translated it as I did, because it explicitly says """"the boys with their X"""", and not somthing like """"the two x-like boys"""".  12:44, 5 Jun 2004 (UTC)

An interesting link: Wooden puppet is performed almost the same way as the wayang kulit, but there is no screen in front of the puppeteer, and no banana trunk to stuck the wayang. In stead a 'Plangkan' (permanent wooden table with holes) to support the wooden puppets is used.''
 12:52, 5 Jun 2004 (UTC)

 Hmm. Looks like we could have a copyvio on our hands. That would really be a pain after so much work went into a translation. I'm not sure quite what to do with this...   02:30, Jun 6, 2004 (UTC)

 Referencing: the addition of inline citations would help improve the verifiability of the information in the article. For a successful B class review the article requires at least one in line citation per paragraph or block of information (more if multiple sources were used);
 Coverage: there are large sections in complete which need to be finished before it can be assessed properly. Additionally, the article does not seem to indicate when the Division was disbanded, or what its fate was after WWI. Was it disbanded, if so was it ever re-raised?

Just a few ideas. If you would like more comprehensive comments regarding the article you might like to submit it for peer review by going to WP:MHPR, but I suggest waiting until the article has been completed before doing this. Also once you feel it requires re-assessment, please add it to the list at WP:MHA. Hope this helps.",0
"Well there's only one thing for it, isn't there? Do try this at home (aka OR). ) Funny I never tried this before. I just filled a condom (Chess, a cheap brand) with about three liters of water and it held. I didn't dare pick it up solely with the 'end' (what should I cal that?), for fear of breaking it, and it's night now, so I'll do more outdoor experimenting tomorrow. But I could pick it up while supporting the bottom. A bit wobbly, but no problem. Of course condoms have to be of quite good quality, for their orginal purpose. I havent tried drinking the water yet, though. Shoud be ok though, because the spermicide is on the outside only. And I don't know where I might get condoms without spermicide. I'll be visiting my outdoor store, Demmenie, one of these days, and then I'll ask. This much handling causes sticky hands, though. And hard to wash oof too. Normally I only handle condoms lightly with my finger tips. But more experimental info tomorrow.",0

The above paragraph is total nonsense.  It has no meaning.  Saying """"God is a paradox"""" is equivalent to saying """"God cannot exist"""" and I don't think that was your intent.  In addition, claiming that infinity cannot be understood is a vague statement at best, and even if true it still wouldn't be an argument for the existence or omnipotence of a god.  Lastly, you clearly didn't understand the God/rock argument so let me try to help.  If you claim the answer is yes, then God has a limit, if the answer is no, then God also has a limit.  Therefore God, or any being for that matter, must have limits of some kind.

Part III

What's with blanking out the names completely? So much for compromise. I'm going back to COUNTING the pre-1925 champions. Here's why:

1. The outside sources, such as the Encyclopedia Britannica, list them.

2. All the arguments that could be made against the pre-1925 French tournament could also be made against the other three.

3. The idea of the """"slam"""" didn't even emerge until the 1930s, with Don Budge...but do we see anyone black out pre-1938 Wimbledon champs?

4. It's clear that the French tournament was MORE open...their first champ was a Brit, as was two runners-up in the early decades. Interestingly, the US """"Open"""" in 1881 was open only to Americans, and was for several years. Yet we count them, because that's the origin of the tournament.

5. There's also the pro-am dispute, pre-1968. 

6. Wikipedia is supposed to reflect pluralistic viewpoints, not just the one of one person such as Fyunclick who violates WP:OWN to contort this and similar tennis articles to reflect his own views, rather than reflecting outside sources that existed long before Wikipedia did.

wikipedia's censorship

I looked up Bash Back (The sodomite terrorist group that attacked the Church in Michigan) on wikipedia  (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_Back) just to see what liberal bias they would have. Under the section """"Antifascist action at 2008 Milwaukee Pridefest"""" Wakopedia says """"In response, Bash Back! Milwaukee planned a confrontation of the hate group."""" the """"hate group they are talking about is the NAZIs but then if the NAZIs are a hate group then Bash back must also be a hate group so I edited it to say """"In response, The hate group Bash Back! Milwaukee planned a confrontation of the hate group.""""

Since they also didn't have any topic for the new terrorist attack on the church I added a few lines & was attacked by the Admins. So they added the following paragraph
2008 Disruption at Mt. Hope Church in Lansing, MI

Bash Back! members disrupted a Sunday sermon at Mt. Hope Church in Lansing, Michigan on November 9th, 2008. They dropped a banner in the church, threw thousands of fliers, made out in front of the congregation, yelled """"Jesus was a Homo"""", pulled the fire alarm and initiated pro-gay chants. Mt. Hope is an Assemblies of God church which holds and promotes """"ex-gay"""" events and preaches that homosexuality is a sin.

I edited the first line of the paragraph to read """"Christaphobic Bash Back! members disrupted.... & added the following footnote 

""""Christphobia (from Greek Christós: Messiah; phóbos: fear, phobia) is an irrational fear of, aversion to, or discrimination against Christianity.""""

I took the defanition word for wors from Wakopedia's definition for Homophobia & just changed the Homo/Christos & Homo/ Christian parts.

For this I received the following note from the admin

This is the last warning you will receive for your disruptive edits, such as those you made to Bash Back. If you vandalize Wikipedia again, you will be blocked from editing. Please maintain a neutral point of view. ukexpat (talk)

 Undue weight on one controversy - proposed solution

Topical or thematic sections are frequently superior to sections devoted to criticism"""" and """"Sections or article titles should generally not include the word 'controversies'.""""

This article shouldn't have a standalone """"Controversies"""" section; controversies should be discussed in context in the """"History"""" section if they're important to the history of the university. Looking at the current """"History"""" section, it's very brief - for example, there are only two sentences about the May 2014 IV killings, which is very important in the history of UCSB, and it doesn't mention the 2001 IV killings, which are also important to its history. There is a longer article at History of the University of California, Santa Barbara with more room for detail.

"Topics for Revising Gravity article 

What was challenging? 
For film's that propose questions about reality and controversy- an opportunity is deemed by users to not only post information about the film/actors/production, etc, but also to discuss themes present in the movie. Drifting away from that note, the article itself meets the standards to being a good article. There are little to none spelling errors, and information is almost spot-on with the right dates, people, and nomination facts. But that may be the overall problem of this article...is it too much factual based? Are people necessarily not focused on the article itself but rather the movie? In order to improve not only the article but the revisions to the essay, I will focus on how the film can compare to previous NASA space missions.
Possible Topics for Article Gravity (Film):

Imdb.com 

Factual Errors/ Scientific Accuracy
-Stars do not twinkle in the realms of space. If you are located on the earth’s surface, you might witness the twinkling of stars because of the earth’s atmosphere. 
-When Kowalski and Stone are stuck between cords in a spacecraft, Kowalski orders to be let go of and is then sent through space, floating away with decreasing oxygen levels. This is incorrect because both are in the same orbit, so a small tug would have worked to pull Kowalski toward safety. 
- When Dr. Stone gets back into the spacecraft, she initially takes off her spacesuit. Two parts are missing: Liquid Cooling & Ventilation Garment. In the film, Stone goes through an extreme amount of stress and excitement, leaving her to be awfully sweaty underneath her spacesuit. However, as she takes it off, there are no signs of sweat, which does not make sense.

 From Jimbo Wales, paraphrased from this post from September 2003 on the mailing list:

 If a viewpoint is held by a significant minority, then it should be easy to name prominent adherents;
 If a viewpoint is held by an extremely small (or vastly limited) minority, it does not belong in Wikipedia regardless of whether it is true or not and regardless of whether you can prove it or not, except perhaps in some ancillary article.

Keep in mind that in determining proper weight we consider a viewpoint's prevalence in reliable sources, not its prevalence among Wikipedia editors.

 WP:SPA / sockpuppet accounts 

Admins: Please note that per Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/St_Christopher, accounts which have the single purpose of editing this article and its talk page may be considered as a single editor, are restrained from making disruptive edits, and may be banned if they do so.  Current single purpose accounts are:   

This is how Leuko typically tries to deal with editors who don't agree with his point of view when editing this article, he tries to silence them rather than hash it out in good faith. You can see that my account in not single purpose since I have a number of edits (minor, but still edits, I'm more of a WikiGnome in other areas) in other articles. You will also notice that even though  

Actually 75% of the contribs from this IP address are related to this article, so considering other people may have made some of the non-related edits, that indicates that this is a WP:SPA for editing this article. I grouped the SPA's together because as the ArbCom case said, they can be regarded as a single editor using sockpuppets when editing disruptively. I'll add the other one too if it makes you happy. I try and WP:AGF too, but it's hard with the history of abusive sockpuppetry and personal attacks perpetuated in the past, which still continues.  

75% means that 1 out of 4 edits has been on articles outside this area, that's not a terrible ratio, and certainly shows this is not a WP:SPA. Also, if you look at the quality of the edits you will notice that the majority of that 75% are to rephrase comments I have made or simple/minor spacing or formatting issues. It may be your opinion that the edits by the users you listed were """"disruptive"""" but I doubt you will find a reasonable person that will agree with you on this. I agree that it's unfortunate that some biased editors continue there attacks and campaign of disinformation but it seems that some people just can't help themselves.  

Demanding that information be removed because other editors would not provide you with a physical copy of a newspaper article which is cited is definitely not productive.  Now I had to look up what a buckytube was, but I don't think this comment was very supportive of the nature of the edits on this page: .  

Well, that's your opinion. Actually, since you were able to prove the existence of the article without a physical copy demonstrates that it was rather easy to obtain verification. I don't think asking for verification for information that is included in an article in what is supposedly an """"encyclopedia"""" is asking too much. Without verification Wikipedia would be no better than any other garbage out there on the internet. Do you really think that even basic verification to prove that material even existed is unnecessary?  

Yes, it was rather easy to obtain for someone who had the desire to actually re-verify a source which has been there for a year. I don't know why it needed to be such a difficult process.  

You tell me, you were the one that was complaining about it being so difficult.

 Understanding how to write Wikipedia articles 

You are obviously a single-purpose account, contributing only to Ashwant Dwivedi. The chances are high that either you are that person, you are related to him or you know him personally. In any event, you are pretty consistently making a mess of things at the article and I'm struggling to clean up the problems that you create. It's not a vendetta against you as a person, though.

There is little doubt in my mind that you would benefit from contributing to a wider range of articles in order to gain exposure to how we actually write things here. There is, for example, no rationale for including every news story that you can find about a person - especially not when they are trivial soundbites or repetitive information - nor is there any need to misrepresent sources by saying he is a """"Pacific Islands Diplomat"""" when, at best, he was a Fijian one. Things like this would be more obvious to you if you were not so constrained by your self-imposed concentration on one article. They would also be more obvious if you actually tried discussing things with other people and listening to what they say. I'm not always right but I am pretty experienced here and, as with anything in life, one key way to learn is to pick up things from those who have done it before.

I'm absolutely fed up with you at the moment, having given you a massive amount of rope over many months. But I'm quite happy to let bygones by bygones if only you can actually demonstrate a willingness to develop your skills here. The article will, in my opinion, be deleted anyway but there is much else here that you could work on in the future if you are prepared to spend a bit of time understanding how Wikipedia works.

Mentioning Darwin gave up natural selection and became a Lamarckian

The article currently makes no mention of the historically important fact that Darwin himself converted from the natural selection theory of evolution to a Lamarckian environmentalist position in later editions of The Origin of Species, which went into 6 different editions by 1872. Hence I propose the following insert at the first Darwin quotation in the current section ‘Publication of the theory of natural selection’, which I also propose should be retitled ‘Publication of the Darwin’s theory of evolution’.

Proposed insert:

'However,  even in the first edition of his book Darwin only claimed natural selection was the main means of selection, but not the only one. In the last sentence of its Introduction he said “Furthermore, I am convinced that natural selection has been the main but not exclusive means of modification.”

But by 1872 he had published six editions of the book with corrections and revisions, and in later editions in response to criticism of his theory of inheritance Darwin even gave up the theory of natural selection as the main selector of evolution, with its strong principle of inheritance, in favour of Lamarckian environmentalism, with a changing environment as the main selector. As C.D. Darlington wrote in 1950 in his Foreword to a new and first reprint of the otherwise unavailable first edition of The Origin:

""""Let no one imagine, however, that, in the world of science, Darwin's theory has enjoyed an unchequered prosperity. On the contrary the dust of battle is only now beginning to settle on the hotly disputed ground....The most abiding source of trouble was that discovered  by the Professor of Engineering at Edinburgh. Professor Fleming[sic] Jenkin pointed out in 1867, that any new variation appearing in one individual would be lost or swamped in later generations when that individual was compelled to cross with others of the old and established type, and its differences, as Darwin believed, blended in inheritance. Nature would never be able to keep any differences to select. 

Darwin's defence against this objection was already prepared. He had hinted it in the first edition of The Origin of Species: at the end of the Introduction he had said that """"Natural Selection has been the main but not exclusive means of modification."""" In later editions he hedged further. He fell  back on the other means. These depended chiefly on the action of a changing environment: its direct effect in altering living things so as to suit it must be inherited. In adopting this view Darwin was giving up his own, and Wallace's, peculiar claim to originality: he was giving up the argument implied in the title of the book: and he was falling back on the discarded and disreputable theory of Lamarck."""" 
[p. xvii On the Origin of Species by means of Natural Selection first edition reprint in The Thinker's Library by Watts & Co, 1950.] '

But Darlington failed to establish Lamarck's theory was discarded or disreputable. In fact the theory of natural selection only became accepted in the mid-20th century with the ‘Mendelian-Darwinian synthesis’ in population genetics. But even by 1950 Darwinism was still not accepted in academia according to Darlington:

""""In view of the triumph of his ideas it might be thought that Darwinism, in all civilised countries, would be taught as one of the foundations of thought, that in the universities everywhere it would be critically expounded and experimentally developed. That is true of its remote and general applications to such sciences as astronomy and geology. But where, as in its applications to ourselves, in the study of the genetics of men, and to the histories of nations, as exact knowledge of the principles of variation, hybridization and selection is required, we hear on every side nothing but confused and ignorant speculations. At the same time the foundation of Darwinism in the experimental study of evolution has largely been smothered in Darwin's own country. The Universities, with their museums and botanic gardens, are happy to forget what, in 1859, they were unable to resist. They contain no memorial of his work,  and all the means of developing his doctrine they frustrate by an arrangement of teaching which the theory of evolution is not allowed to disturb. The old pedantic learning of botany and zoology, which Darwin treated as one subject, they continue to cleave asunder, burying the halves under their ancient schedules of instruction."""" [‘’ibid’’ pxviii-xix]. '

I also propose the following edit of the article's introduction:

"NIHH Science Update • December 15, 2010

Scientists at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore led by Mikhail Pletnikov developed the mouse model used in this study by inserting a gene with a mutation known to be associated in humans with schizophrenia, depression, and bipolar disorder. They used a technique that allows them to turn the gene on and off at desired time points during brain development. In earlier research, mice with the gene, mhDISC1 (mutant human disrupted-in-schizophrenia-1) showed effects on social behavior and mood which differed depending on the sex of the mice, and the age at which the gene was active. The study shows brain development is more complex than originally thought and the argument between nature v. nature is not an easy question. The mutated gene has more control than originally thought.

The figure used on this page isn't the number of people who self-identify as """"Black"""", it's the estimated number of people with some degree of African ancestry... in Latin America in general and Venezuela in particular these are very different things - """"black"""" only applies to people who have sole or predominately African ancestry, while people of mixed ancestry generally consider themselves """"Brown"""" (""""Moreno"""") on the census (presumably this is what you are calling """"mestizo""""). If we simply used the """"Black"""" figure from the census we'd be ignoring the large number of people who have mixed African and European/Native American ancestry. We can't use the """"Brown"""" figure either, as this would include many people who have both European and Native American ancestry but no African ancestry. So the census figures are no good for us and we need to find a different source that estimates African ancestry directly without using the """"black""""/""""brown"""" colour labels. The 20-30% estimation comes from an official document from the Venezuelan government (the Embassy in the US) which specifically states this as the number of people with African ancestry, so is a reliable source for our purposes. If you have an equal or better reliable source that gives an alternative figure then please let me know what it is. 
The 100% issue is a red herring - """"mestizo"""" and """"African ancestry"""" are overlapping categories and can't be added together as if they were distinct... """"mestizo"""" in Venezuela means a mixture of European, Native American and/or African ancestry, so some of the people included in """"mestizo"""" are also included in """"African ancestry"""" and you'd be counting them twice if you added the two together. A better check is that we'd expect """"Afican ancestry"""" to be all of the """"Black"""" category plus part of the """"Brown"""" category, so more than 3% and less than 53% - the 20-30% estimate fits this perfectly.

 Dark Energy, Dark Matter, MOND and still more """"Critique of the Universe"""" 

This goes to the whole question of the exclusive use of a single model of the universe that depends on the Friedmann equations and the FLRW metric. The consensus interpretation of the Lambda/cold dark matter model must clearly be flawed if it leads to the conclusion that the scientific method must be scrapped in order to save the model (ref). Dark Matter and Dark Energy are ad hoc """"add-ons"""" that are trying to find theoretical justification. Dark Enegy, in particular, is being called a supernatural or """"unfalsifiable"""" hypothesis because no experiment can possibly directly challenge it (ref), just like the existence of God hypothesis.

Heretofore, all hypotheses must adhere to the scientific method (ref), """"the SM"""". Now, in order to admit Dark Energy, cosmologists insist that SM must be tinkered with and an unfalsifiable hypothesis allowed for the first time in history. If we do this, the Pope can re-ascend to the Throne.

All of the indirect """"overwhelming evidence"""" for expansion rate acceleration and Dark Energy can be just as well applied to the concept that our inventory of matter and energy in our local universe is inadequate and that the mass of the global universe is at least 22.2 times as large as has been supposed (100%/4.5% = 22.2). The total mass of the universe has been and still is open to question. The Matter/Energy that we can inventory accounts for only 4.5% of the total needed to """"flatten"""" the anisotropy pattern that is seen in the Cosmic Microwave Background radiation or """"CMB"""" (ref). This proposed revision in the """"total mass"""" and the General Relativity (GR) concept of the black hole hyperbolic field will save not only SM, but the Friedmann Equations and the FLRW metric themselves too! 

The """"inflaton particle"""" from which the universe may have sprung was the mother of all black-holes (MOAB). As such, it must have possessed an hyperbolic gravitational field that existed timelessly according to Alan Guth's quantum principles (ref). During the instant of inception of the differentiated universe that we can now detect, this hyperbolic field must have begun to degenerate. Space with time came into existence during this instant. The implication here of the prior existence of a sort of meta-universe is not explicitly acknowledged in any of the scenarios we read, but it is nonetheless an unstated assumption. 

This space-time bubble's surface traveled up the MOAB's hyperbolic field gradient at a velocity hundreds or thousands of times the speed of light. This is Allan Guth's """"Inflation"""". Matter/Light could keep pace with the inflation of space-time only as long as its temperature was several exponential decades of degrees Kelvin. As soon as Matter/Light began to condense and the fundamental forces began to differentiate, the inflation era ended (ref). The collapse of the infinite density hyperbolic field began. This hyperbolic field has been collapsing by means of a time-dependent process ever since. It is this ongoing transition from a hyperbolic black hole gravitational field to a parabolic Newtonian gravitational field underlying the global universe that is being mistaken for acceleration and Dark Energy (ref).

This is not speculation. This is not my personal idea. This is but one example of a different logical meaning of Allan Guth's inflation theory (ref)and General Relativity according to Schwartzchild (ref) and many others. When guided by correct meta-logic, mathematical physicists will be able to validate this or some other theoretical interpretation of GR, the Friedmann equations and the FLRW metric. Then, with the demise of Dark Energy and Dark Matter, the scientific method will be saved (ref).

Most people looking for this article will already be at least marginally aware that the surgical techniques Toby Meltzer has pioneered have given him renown among his peers, patients, and potential patients.

I'm wondering whether to add the fact to the article that she recently received a bukkake from five black dudes and the video was uploaded to slutload.com. She was first face f*ucked. I'm not sure if it's notable enough to include but it was recent (rather surprising news) and her husband is filing for a divorce after she refused to swallow his sperm. I don't have a definite source for this, unfortunately. If I did, I would add it to the article. Anyone have any references?

"I am moving the list of european supporters to here otherwise her biography page gets clogged up with names of supporters. The only support which matters is next year at election 2012. The experts say that Manipuris are backward and need to be educated about democracy. The arab spring has taught the experts that it is the people who need to educate their political masters on what kind of democracy they want. I hope Manipuris at last take the opportunity to free Sharmila and rid Manipur of the black law next year.

On 28 November 2010, UK Green Party leader and European Parliament member Keith Taylor wrote to the Indian government seeking the release of Sharmila and the repeal of the AFSPA. Her main supporter in the European Union is Sir Graham Watson KB MEP  chair of the India/EU delegation of MEPs. He has consistently made interventions on her behalf most recently to Dr J Bhagwati Indian Ambassador to the EU who responded on 1 July 2011 to his request to respond to the death threats made against Irom Sharmila. Indian Ambassadors reference BRU/AMB/48/2011 Embassy of India, 1050 Brussels. He responds only that he understands that Irom Sharmila is a hunger striker and that the modification of AF(SP)A is under consideration. Previously in April 2011 Sri Graham Watson and the EU delegation had tried to visit Manipur but were not allowed to do so by the Indian Authorities. They visit each year this year they were allowed to visit, Delhi, Patna and Mumbai. Although Keith Taylor did write three letters on one occasion he has never responded to further input. Sri Graham Watson and other members of the EU delegation do always respond to further requests for help. For example a Dutch member of the India EU delegation Peter Van Dalen whose special interest group is Dalit and subaltern groups released this press statement for publication at the gathering at her tenth anniversary of fasting in November 2010  Smt Sharon Bowles MEP sent Sharmila a personal letter of support which is now with Sharmila. She had added her personal regret that Sharmila was not nominated for the Sakharov last year due to insufficient support from other MEPs a nomination requires at least 40 MEP signatories. This year's nominations close on 13 September 2010. Another MEP member of the EU/India Delegation has stated that he does not believe Sharmila will be nominated this year either as very few MEPs know of her or Manipur.

The European MEPs were initially brought in by one of her Western campaigners Nicholas Crawford a philosophy student at Gonville & Caius College, Cambridge. He also chairs a small student think tank. The Wilberforce Society. At the annual garden party Mr Crawford gave a speech about Irom Sharmila and the AFSPA in attendance was their patron Lord Wilson, a former head of the civil service, and Sir Christopher Hum, former UK ambassador to China. Before Xmas they hope to have a seminar on India and Human Rights. And plan to visit Manipur and Sharmila next summer. Sharmila has many letters from offices of Western Dignatories including those of HM Queen Elizabeth II, The Duchess of Cornwall, The President of Eire, Tony Blair and most recently the Scottish First Minister and the Mayor of London all stating that they are sorry about her circumstances but are unable to offer her any assistance. But she has always cared more about genuine letters seeking to make connections.",0

I understand the confusion. You would think that since a primary source is a first-hand account, it would be the most reliable. However, the person or group involved could have a biased viewpoint. Also, there may be multiple viewpoints on the event in question that differ from one another. That's when a secondary source comes in. A secondary source's author is """"one step removed"""" from the event reducing the chance of bias, and often uses several primary sources to form an opinion, evaluation, and/or conclusion. Furthermore, secondary sources are more likely to be published – the editorial oversight of the publishing process is extremely valuable here. It helps us avoid original research. One of the biggest problems with Wikipedians relying on primary sources is that they often find themselves forming their own conclusions, whether intentionally or not, which would be considered original research.

This was a significant evolution from the first generation stealth aircraft represented by the SR-71 and A-12. Second generation stealth as evidenced by the F-117 had yet to allow aerodynamic efficiency to co-exist with stealth.

Wikipedia Regrets The Errors

[Suggested Text]:

From June to September of 2007, several false and misleading critical statements appeared at the National Civilian Community Corps (also known as AmeriCorps NCCC) page (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Civilian_Community_Corps), in violation of Wikipedia standards.  This is the false text as it appeared:

National Civilian Community Corps

""""...Criticisms
The NCCC program has met with sharp criticisms from some fiscal conservatives who accused it of being a """"boondoggle"""".[4] Most notably, Libertarian pundit and commentator James Bovard has been one of the most vocal Americorps NCCC opponents, calling it a """"waste and fraud""""[5], in addition to dedicating an entire chapter of criticisms of the program in his book """"Feeling Your Pain: The Explosion and Abuse of Government Power in the Clinton-Gore Years."""" Robert Sweet, the former director of the National Institute of Education, labeled it """"a fraud"""".
^ http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,188385,00.html ^ http://www.enterstageright.com/archive/articles/1000americorps.htm""""

Wikipedia relies on its readers and volunteer contributors to avoid or challenge and correct misleading or false information.

The following has been called to our attention:

1.  The statement that read """"...Bovard has been one of the most vocal Americorps NCCC opponents, calling it a """"waste and fraud,"""" cited as its source an article at this address by Bovard: http://www.enterstageright.com/archive/articles/1000americorps.htm  Nowhere in that article does Bovard make that statement.  No mention of """"AmeriCorps NCCC"""" nor of the """"National Civilian Community Corps"""" appears in that article, nor is AmeriCorps NCCC called a 'waste and fraud.""""  We regret the error.

2. The same sentence went on to state the following:  """"...Bovard has been one of the most vocal Americorps NCCC opponents, calling it a """"waste and fraud"""", in addition to dedicating an entire chapter of criticisms of the program in his book """"Feeling Your Pain ...""""

Upon investigation, this statement turns out to be untrue.  Bovard's book (published in hardcover by St. Martin's press) does not contain a chapter of criticisms of AmeriCorps NCCC in the book """"Feeling Your Pain.  In fact, neither """"AmeriCorps NCCC"""" nor the """"National Civilian Community Corps are mentioned at all in the text of that book nor in the book index.  (The chapter in question concerns the umbrella program, AmeriCorps, but does not mention the program known as """"AmeriCorps NCCC'"""" or the """"National Civilian Community Corps"""".

(The only mention to NCCC is in the footnotes, referring to a speech by then-president Clinton, praising, not criticizing, the NCCC.)

In sum, the book """"Feeling Your Pain"""" does not dedicate """"an entire chapter of criticisms"""" of AmeriCorps NCCC, contrary to the information posted at the Wikipedia website.  We regret the error.

3.  Also untrue was the sentence """"Robert Sweet, the former director of the National Institute of Education, labeled it [i.e., AmeriCorps NCCC] """"a fraud"""".  This sentence was misleading and false.  It was placed at the National Civilian Community Corps page and referred to the antecedent in the previous sentence, the AmeriCorps NCCC.

The claim relied on the article by Bovard at http://www.enterstageright.com/archive/articles/1000americorps.htm.  No mention of either the """"National Civilian Community Corps"""" nor of """"AmeriCorps NCCC"""" appears in that article.  No evidence has been put forward to support the statement that Mr. Sweet ever labeled AmeriCorps NCCC a """"fraud.""""  We regret the error.

Wikipedia deeply regrets that this misleading text appeared at our National Civilian Community Corps website and that it persisted for as long as it did.

The editor responsible for its appearance and continued re-emergence will no longer have access to the National Civilian Community Corps Wikipedia entry.

Signed: _____

Calls to move forward on the National Civilian Community Corps page, to be a team player, etc., would be better received by this editor if Wikipedia posted a note something like the above at the NCCC site  - not to mention, it might restore some of Wikipedia's credibility on this subject.   Given the nature of the NCCC - a substantial and serious component of U.S. disaster relief and mitigation capacity - and its recent near-demise following misleading claims like those posted at Wikipedia, the statement above is not written as amusement.

I invite everyone to review the posts.  conveniently gone through the trouble of tracking them down, and they are available in the RfC he's preparing agaisnt me.

I'm do not know where all of these IP users came from. In the event that they did come from LiveJournal, I have edited the LJ posts I made, asking any users who came to Wikipedia to read through an introduction to Wikipedia, and to create an account. I also put emphasis against Personal attacks. I can't do anything more about it. If you feel this is untrue, then please, please, bring it up to me, before your decide to take up other peoples' time with the issue. I know I make mistakes, and I try to fix them when I can. I like people to tell me when they think I make them, as obviously, I don't realize all of them. 

Personal Attacks: I called  """"ignorant."""" In the atmosphere I've developed in, that's not anything close to an attack. I do apologize if anyone took offense to it, as they seem to have. I came out of the exchange feeling attacked as well. We seem to have had a cultural misunderstanding. I'll refrain from the practice of using that word as such in this environment (on Wikipedia). This is the only personal attack I remember anyone bringing to me. If you have others, please tell me. Otherwise, please stop saying that I am attacking anyone. It was an isolated incident, and we both seem to have gotten over it. Why can't you? Stop bringing it up. 

During the time I was gone, a bunch of anonymous users seem to have popped up here. However, none popped up at any of the other articles I am concerned with (Scottish Clans; view my contributions if you're interested). I refute any claims that are made to connect me with these users.

I in no way endorse the attacks that were made upon anyone in my absence, or any attacks for that matter. I want to make that clear, and final. If you have something against me, then be honest.

 No. Not many people have ever heard of the octothorpe name, in my circles. It was called """"the number sign"""", after the phone companies usage on keypads, until about five to ten years ago. The last few years online (seeming to lead the pack and culture) started to call it a """"pound sign"""", always known to expeditor people for weight, always appearing at the end of a number (eg. CW#). Both of those appear to be usages and not the symbol's name. Now I was told, loosely, that it was an octothorpe but since have discovered the term may be a broad one that covers many eight sided figures. (what else?).

"Records of Awesome Editors Who Truly Want To Help==

As this is not a study of people's hesitancy, it is not a suitable source for claims about the reasons for people's hesitancy. It would appear to be at best a study making claims about vaccines themselves, not a study about hesitancy or about controversy. If this study is the reason for people's hesitancy, then we should be pointing to a reliable third-party source that states that it's the reason, not to the study itself. If we say people stopped going to the beach because of the film Jaws, we use as a reference the source that makes that statement, not the film itself. So no, it's not a reliable source for what you claim you want to use it for. Nat Gertler (talk) 

That has got to be the clearest explanation yet. So what you are saying is cite a source that says there is controversy over the vaccine schedule because there is a correlation with infant mortality, then cite both sources? Or should I use opinion pieces like most of the other references in the article? Even the journal of medicine piece is an opinion piece. Is this where wiki gets the facts, from opinions, then excludes peer reviewed journal articles because it is WP:OR? It is built by popular opinion of the editors, from opinion pieces, not allowing facts...if this is indeed true....though I hope notDcrsmama (talk) 
No, I'm not saying cite both sources. References are there to verify the facts that are being stated in Wikipedia's voice. If the statement being sourced is that there is a controversy due to correlation with infant mortality, then we cite a source that is discussing the controversy - there is no need to cite the study. Even if the source says that there is a controversy because of this particular study, we might mention this study in the text, but the study itself is not reference for the statement. And I am addressing the specific request for input that you made in your initial posting. If you have concerns about the other sources in the article, you may wish to raise them in a specific post about the specific concerns. Nat Gertler (talk)

[Moved post from Sarah down to proper chronological space; it interrupted my unblock request subsection placed chronologically before it above.   ]

As one of the victims of your repeated and persistent personal attacks and false accusations, I don't think that you should be unblocked early because I feel that a message needs to be sent about your continued personal attacks, blatant violations of AGF, CIVIL and NPA, which are even prominently displayed on this very talk page in your lengthy commentaries about Orderinchaos in particular. I have tried to stay away from here since the ANI was closed, but as you continue making accusations and comments about me, I must say that I consider your comments to be personal attacks and I consider the post that Gnangarra linked to in particular to be defamatory and libelous and I feel that you should agree to refactor those comments, and the other personal attacks you made about editors on ANI, as I see has also been previously suggested by Shell as well. The """"do not edit the archive"""" notices in the ANI archives are designed to prevent people from continuing discussions in the archives, rather than to prevent people removing defamatory material. You claim that you've been """"slandered"""" (actually libeled). I believe everything I have said about you has been absolutely true, however, if I have inadvertently made a mistake and it was pointed out to me, I would redact it. Unfortunately, every time I have interacted with you you have made demonstrably false accusations, accusing me of doing things I had clearly and provably not done at all and so I am rather reluctant to believe that I have posted something factually untrue, but I am quite prepared to go back and re-examine my comments and refactor if I have made a mistake. When you wrote these offensive and defamatory comments about me, I had been deliberately trying to refrain from saying very much on the ANI due to your previous hostile reactions to me and had actually made very few comments, only responding to people who were confused or misunderstood and thus your accusations at that point in time were totally over the top and unfair and did not measure up to the evidence of my posts. Additionally, you are completely anonymous and not known by your real life identity, whereas I have spent most of my time on Wikipedia editing under my full name and am well known and you yourself have even commented about knowing my full name, so I find your comments and accusations defamatory to me in the real world. I feel you should agree to refactor your personal attacks against, not just myself, but others too, and I must therefore support previous requests for you to refactor these personal attacks and false accusations. Please also note that BLP applies to all pages on Wikipedia, not just to articles, Wikipedia:BLP#Non-article_space, and so if you persist in keeping your personal comments about me, a living, known and identifiable person, I must once again for the nth time insist that you provide verifiable proof supporting your allegations and accusations because you are in violation of BLP. Sarah 

Gnan, Shell, Sarah: Please see reply posted to Shell below #Malfunctioning archive bot and improper page creations? prior to the reply by Sarah; did not see it; restored proper chronological order to these posts.  Sarah: In #request (first line of my reply) I already gave permission to Gnan/garra to do what is needed in that now-unmentionable (for me) matter to remove from it anything that might be (mis)construed as a """"personal attack"""" by anyone reading it WP:NPA in reply to #request; but I myself do not feel comfortable touching an archived discussion in a project page, which is filled with comments that could be (mis)construed as """"personal attacks"""" upon me as well (""""rant"""", """"screed"""", expletives, etc.).  Please post comments chronologically.  The bot functions to archive them that way.  Thanks.   04:35""",0

ST's initiative was geared at editor retention, the way I see it. As he mentioned on his Talk page, he prefers facilitating collaboration than meting out discipline.
Unfortunately, there are problems with COI on Wikipedia, etc, and these issues are not all amenable to touchy-feely solutions. 
Although I haven't broached the possibility before, this case provides the opportunity for a hypothetical scenario. Supposing that the Koch brothers, to whommoney is no object, have some funds allocated in their PR efforts that include Wikipedia. Well, such editors are not going to be amenable to reason, because they would be being paid not to be reasonable.

Friedmans words are clearly quoted and clearly cited via the article linked to. A source you have removed for some reason. Do you have something to contribute from """"Blitzers side""""? Please, by all means include it. Is lack of something from """"Blitzers side"""" a reason to exclude citicism and delete a large chunk of the article? I dont think so. Unless you can actually defend your changes citing policy you will need to revert them. 

To clarify, yes, Near East Report is an AIPAC publication, as I said four days ago. Whether it was published by AIPAC in the 70s, I don't know, although it is likely. What we do know is that Blitzer started working for the JPost in 1973. He may very well have edited a version of """"Myths & Facts"""" in 1976, by the way, en edition of that book was published every two years. Plenty of journalists do outside work. Keep in mind that we are an encyclopedia. You need a reliable source thats says who he worked for and the dates. Pulling this information together from different primary sources is original research. You cannot quote somebody as calling Near East Report a """"propaganda sheet"""" any more than another editor can say """"Belfast is inhabited by """"drunken and violent"""" Irish people with the quote cited to Thomas Nast. You also can't cite three people attacking Blitzer's scholarship in Territory of Lies without any response from Blitzer or his supporters.  

Firstly, I wont respond to your silly example referring to where I live. Your racism is disgusting and reflects only on you but thats your problem.

Secondly, please dont further insult the intelligence of editors by implying that Near East Report was *possibly* published by someone else in 1970s. Blitzer edited the book ergo he worked for AIPAC, likewise he was editor of the weekly publication Near East Report into 1978. Source? The directoy listing showing his name listed as the responsible party at the weekly. He worked for them in 1976,77,78 regardless of whether you seek to portray that as """"outside work"""" or anything else. His name is on the front cover of the book as editor right? His name is listed in the weekly publication as editor right? Are those facts in dispute by you? 

Friedmans words are his own, you removed not only the quote whos inclusion you disagree with but all the other details. Fine, remove the quote, but removing everything else? Criticism of Blitzer does belong in the section detailing criticism. An automatic rebuttal isnt necessarily required if its a minority view and/or it cant be located.

It might be releavent to mention that this Mr. yellow Up seems to have a consistent policy of hounding me and trying to get rid of whatever I write which does not fit his political opinions, he does it also in the Hebrew Wikipedia. 
There are some more points which I thought of. The argument of Yellow Up that """"This is just one of thousands of trials against military evaders"""" which was rpeated by Danntm """"just a simple, unimportant court-martial"""" is factually not true. It is very exceptional for the IDF to grant a political objector a full court martial where he can be defended by a lawyer and call witnesses (and make political speeches). It does not happen more often than once in a decade. The usual procedure is """"disciplinary proceedings"""" where you are judged by a commaning officer in his bureau, with no lawyer or witnesses, and it lasts about five minutes - but the officer can only give a maximum of 28 days, unlike the full court martial which can give years. But the descision to have a full court martial is far from routine, it is taken on the highest levels. Then there is the fact that the act which the trial was about - a soldier writing """"subversive"""" graffiti of 117 tanks and other military vehicles - is far from routine, it is certainly unique in Israel and I think quite exeptional for armies worldwide. And finally, Majorly jusitifed the decision to delete by stating """"The vast majority were delete comments, and there seemed to be consensus to delete"""" . Now, I took a look at the deletion log of article submitted on January 8 together with mine . As far as I could see, virtually all of those which were fianlly deleted had a real ovewhelming majoroity in favor, many of them complete unanimity. The court martial artcile had nine in favor of deletion against five opposing deletion (if you don't count my own objection, with it there would be nine to six).  I saw that another article which was put up for deleteion in nearly the same time Arnie_Ginsburg, the result was  """"no concensus, default keep"""".

Machida returned to his native Brazil to face Phil Davis on August 3, 2013 at UFC 163.[44][45] In a unanimous result, Davis defeated Machida via decision.[46][47] 13 of 13 ufc media outlets scored the bout in favor of Machida.[47] Davis had takedowns near the end of rounds one and two, after neither fighter was able to mount any significant offense. Davis mounted significant offense, as it won him the fight. ESPN scored for Davis. Many UFC shills with hall passes that could be taken away and votes on the ufc rankings, but zero in the way of journalistic credentials of any discernible pedigree in journalism scored the fight 30-27 in favor of Machida.[48] UFC promoter, sport hater, and just bleed advocate, Dana White stated shortly after the fight that he had Machida winning all three rounds,[49] and later told Yahoo! Sports that """"Machida definitely won"""" and """"MMA judging sucks"""".[50] Fightmetric Analysis supports this, showing that Machida outstruck Phil Davis, and neutralized 80% of Davis' takedown attempts, with a significantly higher efficiency rating through all three rounds.[51] ESPN released a similar analysis tracking each fighter's activity in each category, and reporting the 29-28 victory for davis.

Remedies
If you are personally attacked, you should ask the attacker to stop and note this policy. If he or she continues, consider following the dispute resolution process. You might also consider removing particularly clear-cut personal attacks per the guideline WP:RPA; however, you should be very careful not to define """"personally attack"""" too broadly, or to do this too frequently. From a recent arbitration committee finding-of-fact:

The remove personal attacks guideline (and the application thereof) is controversial. It has often been abused by malefactors, and may not have community consensus. It should, at most, be interpreted strictly and used sparingly. [1] 
If you find yourself using this remedy frequently, you should reconsider your definition of """"personal attack."""" When in doubt, follow the dispute resolution process instead.

In extreme cases, an attacker may be blocked under the """"disruption"""" clause of the blocking policy, though the practice is almost always controversial. Personal attacks should be reported at WP:PAIN.

Broader context
Use of the term """"psychoanalytic theory"""" implies that there is a core theory which is complete by itself.  This view is not common even among practicing analysts, who in large part recognise that the mind is a function of the brain, so that any full theory of the psyche needs to refer to the brain.  An excellent review of this is Kandel ER (1999) """"Biology and the future of psychoanalysis"""", Am.J.Psychiat 156:505.

Psychoanalytic thinking is inseparably bound also to clinical treatment of patients.  Some purists claim that achieving insight is the only goal of psychoanalysis; but health insurers generally require more concrete goals such as reduced mental illness or increased time at work.  Both of these clinical perspectives assume that the effect on actual patients is important  so they should be included in this article.  An excellent review of the clinical benefits of psychoanalysis is Fonagy, Roth & Higgitt (2005), Bull.Menninger Clinic 69(1):1-58.

This article would not be complete without consideration of substantial attacks on psychoanalysis and its theory, which have reshaped psychiatric practice in the UK and USA over the past 20-30 years.  These attacks can be classified as empirical (Gabbard, Gunderson & Fonagy 2002); financial (Detre & McDonald 1997); theoretical (Meehl 1998 calculates that there are many psychoanalytical explanations possible for any single clinical problem); and circumstantial (e.g. past failures with respect to homosexuality and childhood abuse, and the antipathy of many analysts to quantitative research:  Gabbard, Gunderson & Fonagy 2002).

Psychoanalytic theorists may have over-reached themselves in attempting to account for all troublesome psychic phenomena.  However, their concerted efforts to address more circumscribed areas have produced widely acknowledged, influential advances in the areas of defense mechanisms, attachment, the unconscious, transference and counter-transference, and the treatment of borderline personalities, among others.  Each of these advances has been accompanied by individual theories.

Suggestions for the peer-review
The article should not require a paragraph to describe what it is about; instead, its scope should simply be theories to do with psychoanalysis.  It should include subsections on the question of whether (and how) psychoanalysis can be studied objectively, whether it is disproveable in whole or part (and whether this matters), the informal """"theory"""" of the manners in which analysis can be conducted (e.g. bare room unlike Freud; methods of interpretation), and the relationships with behavioural, cognitive, and psychiatric theories.  It would be useful to have an explanation of why psychoanalysis has resisted decline so much more successfully in France than in anglophone countries.  Rather than complicated sentences with complicated words, we should be treated to simple descriptions of the differences between Freudian, Jungian, and Adlerian thinking.  Possibly in lists if that helps to simplify the sentences.""",0

The client is installing OPGW for their own purposes, I have nothing to do with the selection of the materials - but presumably the client knows what it's doing when it picked OPGW.

"As the dog returneth to his own vomit... .

Brief history: On my return from holiday, last week, I discovered that another editor,  had posted a  which criticises my conduct and alleges that I am part of a concert-party aimed at articles substantially edited by him. During May 26h., I tried to add comments to the page and then had a discussion with him, above, which closed the matter between us.The following day, I posted links on the Talk pages of the other alleged conspirators, one of whom is . The entire correspondence with him reads as follows:

==Discussion involving you==You might be interested in the discussion on my 'Talk Page', here, which indirectly involves you. It is disappointing that the author has not notified you himself.  (talk) Seen all that. Out of context, of course, in every sense. In addition its dredged up from some time back when we were all wrapped over the knuckles then. It seems he wants people perpetually punished for not agreeing with him or for voting on the same pages. I'd hate to list all the AfD and other pages he and Vintagekits collaborate on. But thats all right. Regards,  :Yes; the image of a dog licking its own balls comes to mind. (talk) 

The metaphor is supposed to represent a self-indulgent act which gives great pleasure to the participant but which others view as embarrassing and repulsive.

The next thing I know is that some random Admin has popped up, blocked me, and disappeared again, reappearing on the Administrator's Noticeboard waving my scalp around. The diff link on the Noticeboard refers to the last post only, and a number of commentators on the Noticeboard immediately agree with the view that it is a WP:NPA.

I pause here to point out that either the Admin herself, or I (before I was blocked), could have blanked the comment, perhaps with a warning on this Talk page. I would have been perfectly happy to have done so myself, because I like to think of myself as reasonable and because the post was not intended as an attack; had I wished to criticise  I would have done so on my own Talk page discussion with him. (As it is,  had the sense to blank the discussion in any case.)

Anyway, that said, I reply as follows to those who have posted comments here:

' I hope that I have demonstrated that we're at cross-purposes. Frankly, however, you've made no attempt to engage with either myself or  or to resolve the dispute between us. You might just as well have blocked one of us at random.

' Thank you for yours. You're the dog's bollocks!

' Point taken, for what it's worth (I had initially understood 's complaint to be with the vulgarity of the metaphor rather than her seeing it as an attack). !vote discussions increasingly resemble a mass outbreak of Tourette's syndrome.

' Thank you for yours. I note you seem to have had rather an unpleasant discussion with  yourself on the subject, and I should like to thank you for your interest and understanding. I have also had a look at your User page, which I found very interesting and would like to comment further on your Talk page in due course. To answer your point, I did see how to request an unblock, but as the block was only for 24 hours, and the ground had anyway been cut from under my feet by 's posting on the Administrator's Noticeboard which had garnered approval for the block. I also dislike complaining to Admins about other people's behaviour; it just seems a bit wet to me (and I don't do it myself).

 The Header Dispute 

Since there's a recently started disagreement, perhaps I should start if of here, this edit () what '  What did I do this time? 
See Harvard's treatment in other Wikipedias with regard to """"prestige"""" and Boosterism in Lead, two and three sections above, respectively.   
I agree that we should be vigilant to ensure that college and university articles don't unduly praise their subjects, particularly since it can quickly get out of hand and become meaningless.  But there really are a handful of institutions for whom their prestige is so well-known and widespread that it has become one of their defining characteristics.  Harvard University is one of those institutions.  It's essential for readers to understand that Harvard University is one of the most prestigious universities in the world.  That's what so many people know about it and why its alumni are disproportionately represented among the political and economic elite.  Indeed, it's why so many colleges, universities, and other institutions proclaim themselves to be the """"Harvard of the (region, category, etc.).""""
And please note that we are not claiming that Harvard is'' the most prestigious, the best, or anything else.  We are merely documenting the widespread and essential-to-know perception shared by many people.   
 Agreed completely, and ElKevbo, you are right in claiming that we are not claiming that Harvard isn't the most prestigious as that sounds a bit to peacocky for my own taste, and probably even yours. I think Megapixel will need to understand this. I've noted that ever since I placed some controversial, if peacocky text to the main header about """"Big Three"""", he/she has been repeatedly disagreeing with whatever comes in the headers about the Harvard, Yale, Princeton articles.    ''''''  What did I do this time?
 Some one has changed it back, once again this editor crows to the world, I suggest the accolades are reserved for the US rather than 'the world' or better yet remove it altogether, it is unseemly.   
I suggest that if you don't know that Harvard is considered one of the world's most prestigious universities then you're incompetent to edit this article.  But to placate you I added two more references that explicitly and directly support the assertion.  Can we move on now or should we continue this pointless discussion?   
 Let's end this discussion. Done. If there's more and more reversions on this, we risk getting this article fully protected and admins to only edit it.   ''''''  What did I do this time? 
 Appreciate the comments on this topic. To Abhijay's point above, I am vigilant of disproportionate attributes featured in the header. Please see the Yale talk thread to see how someone tried putting in a """"Big Three"""" comment in the top header that couldn't be referenced in the last 10 years outside of football. The two additional sources that were added are great and appreciated, but this gets to another point in that those articles reference several schools as the 'most prestigious'. Should those other schools (top 10? top 5?) also get a similarly cited blurb that proclaims them as among the most prestigious in their header. I think that's the fair treatment question that should be raised to ensure consistency. No other school has a similar grandiose opening as Harvard when numerous surveys have shown that there are a select few other Universities that hold comparable prestige.  (",0

An album can contain guitars and not-pop vocals but it doesn't make it a rock albums I think. Above all when they have heavy synth or hip-hop/trip hop (like Born to Die) elements And Dream pop? Source says """"Building on her signature dream pop sound..."""". It's not like it directly says """"Her album's genre is Dream pop."""" It's more like talking about Born to Die and she's building some stuff on it. Yes it's better than labeling it Pop (as if Lana is freaking a Madonna or something) but I don't know... Maybe we don't need any genre, huh? I know I'm more like a edition+tracklisting+bonus track monster but it bugs me a little... Any thoughts about it?   """,0

Well, in the definition of the term, ethnic Moldovans are not associated with Romania (I am not saying that the definition is right, just that we have to deal with it, especially on disambig pages). My main point about Sîrbu was that, since he is a Moldovan citizen, and Moldovan-Romanian through this, there is no reason to wonder whether he is also a Moldovan by ethnicity; the only exception would be if Sîrbu is also, according to his own definition, an ethnic Moldovan - but this would still wouldn't matter for the main topic.

Ernie Smith writes 

Æµ§œš¹ I attempted to address the question that you posed regarding other inaccuracies but at the behest of User Hoary I have been blocked by the Wikipedia administrators.  That said, you should carefully examine what I did in fact state regading the four ways that Baugh posits as being the Afrocentric proponent's view on Ebonics.  I maintain that just because a writer happens to be Black or African American (Weddington, Baugh and Green for example) being Black does not make their postion on Ebonics Afrocentric.  What I stated was that; """"the proponents of the term Ebonics view and use the word Ebonics only one way.  That way being; from an Africa centered comparative linguistic perspective.""""  I went on to state that """"In fact, a careful analysis of what Baugh posits as number (iii) reveals that this view is not Afrocentric at all.  That is, the view that Ebonics “is the equivalent of black English and is considered to be a dialect of English"""" (and thus merely an alternative term for African American Vernacular English|AAVE” is Eurocentric.  The other three views, numbers (i), (ii) and (iv), are Afrocentric..."""" 

Æµ§œš¹, if you re-read the quote above carefully you will see that are clearly in error regarding what I stated concerning Baughs number (ii).  So let me make it clear here. It is my view that the first phrse in number (ii)that reads; """"to refer to the languages of the African diaspora as a whole”, is definitely Afrocentric.  What I questioned was the second phrase or clause in number (ii) that reads; “or it may refer to what is normally regarded as a variety of English language|English: either”.  I contend that this phrase contradicts the first phrase and is therefore and oxymoron.  The fact that Eurocentric writers attempt to filch, redfine and use the word Ebonics to """"refer to what is normally regarded as a variety of English language"""" does not make this practice Afrocentric.

To User:DESiegel

I am indeed very well aware that languages change over time. In fact I co-authored a book on the origin of the """"N' word and in that book I extensivly addressed how the meaning of the Kemetic (Egyptian)word NGR has changed.  In this book Shaba Shebaka and I systematically demonstrate that while all English language dictionaries posit the origin of the 'N' word as being derived from the Latin word 'niger' meaning 'black', (See Ullaman, et.al. Third Latin Book (1930:51) the word 'niger' is not originally a Latin word. (see America Heritage Dictionary (1976:1531) That is, while the word 'niger' may have entered into the English langange from Latin, the empirical evidence is that the tri-consonant Mdw Ntr 'NGR' is found in the ancient Kemetic (Egyptian) language thousnds of years before there is any record of a Latin civilization.  The empirical evidence is that the root word NGR was introduced to the Ayran or European people when they initially invaded and made contact with the Negroid people (NGRS) of ancient India around 2000-1000 BC. (See Wallbank and Taylor(1942:72,73)and Durant (1954:356).

In Sir E.A. Wallis Budge's Egypitian Hieroglyphic Dictionary the words NGRS and NGGR can be found in hieroglyphs.  Budge provides the specific site where these hieroglyphs are located in Egypt today.  As defined by Budge the first word NGRS is the name of an ancient Kemetic or Egyptian God (Budge 1978:341).  The second word NGGR is the name of an ancient Kemitic or Egyptian Goddess (Budge 1978:398).  For the Wikipedia reader that may be concerned as to the relavence of this discussion of the 'N' word to Ebonics I strongly urge the reader to examine the etymology and definition of the word """"ebony"""" in any unabridged English language dictionary. The point being made is that there is a subtle linguistic diglossia being imposed that must to be challenged.  Einar Haugen states the point I am making thusly:  """"if we call the building-up of a language an Aufbau and the aphasic dismantling an Abbau, the bilinguals restructuring can be call an Umbau.  This is the goal of all the studies if bilingual interference: in what way has a language been rebuilt or umgebaut because of the coexistence with another language in the minds ofbilingual speakers?""""  Of course to those who view Ebonics as being a dialect of English the idea of 'biligualism' when it comes to the languge of descendants of enslaved Niger-Congo Africans in diappora is unfathomable.

"Paganism in Constantinople

Between 324 and 330, Constantine built ... a new imperial capital at Byzantium on the Bosphorus (it came to be named for him: Constantinople)–the city ... had no pagan temples.

Constantine founded a new city named after himself: Constantinople. Christian writers played up the idea that this was to be a 'new Rome', a fitting Christian capital for a newly Christian empire.

But they had to find ways to explain the embarrassing fact that in this new, supposedly Christian city, Constantine had erected pagan temples and statues.

Hi Rockingchick. Sorry your article was deleted, but it sounds like you were writing a biography of a non-notable person. We can't generally let people write articles about people they know or knew personally because it violates our policies of having everything verified by reliable sources (if you write about someone the wider world hasn't heard of we have no way of making sure what you wrote is true) and writing from a neutral point of view (you can't be neutral about someone you know personally). There are more specific guidelines as to who's considered notable at WP:BIO.

If you'd like some ideas for a good first article, you can try the Your first article (which is more a list of """"don't""""s) and the Requested articles pages. The community portal also has lots of other ways in which people can contribute to Wikipedia apart from writing new articles.

Again in this imaginary world, I would suggest to you that maybe it would be more productive to re-write the damn summary that no one likes rather than, say, to write a new article about Wikilawyering.

I'm telling you this because possibly you find the whole thing very annoying and draining  as indeed I would, if I were continually having to make up new reasons for not doing what is obviously the right thing to do  and if that's the case, this could be a bad situation for you: you're drained while I'm entertained. Now, probably some worthy will turn my words here against me, and claim (ignoring my clear statement that I think you are absolutely wrong in this particular matter) that I am just trying to be annoying to you.

I would like to report a factual error in this article. The error is that it says that WJ Clinton's presidential term began at the end of the cold war.

I request that this article remove and correct this erroneous entry in order to be accurate and correct (an important and very valid Wikipedia motivation). Clinton's term began in 1993, this is two years after the end of the cold war. The George H.W. Bush BLP should also be edited for the factual entry that GHWB served as POTUS (seeing that this is important and was included in WJC BLP) at the time that the cold war ended.

 User:PiCo edit warring again

 Suggested changes (received via email) 

Hi all,

The following proposed changes were received via email to OTRS. I submit them to the talk page for consideration and adaptation by anyone who is interested in the subject matter:

Nathan  Sonenshein (2 August 1915-April 13, 2001) was a rear admiral in the United States
Navy. A native of Lodi, New Jersey, Sonenshein began his four-decade naval career by
attending and receiving a commission from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1938. In 1970, he was
head of the Navy's Bureau of Ships, just before it became the Naval Ship Systems Command.
.

His thirty-six year career in the Navy spanned an era that began on the eve of World War
II and lasted into the seventies.

He was decorated for distinguished performance as Chief Engineer of a carrier during the
Korean War. Later assignments in the Bureau of Ships included that of Director of Ship
Design. After selection to Flag rank, he was chosen as one of the Navy's first Project
Managers. This project led the design of the Fast Deployment Logistics ship, which
portended today's Rapid Deployment Force. In its design, Admiral Sonenshein successfully
pioneered a new approach which quantified for the first time, top level mission
requirements and translated them into ship design parameters to achieve the optimum
functional performance.

At the peak of hostilities in Southeast Asia, a period marked by tremendous strain on
material, personnel and time resources, Admiral Sonenshein was selected to be Commander,
Naval Ship Systems Command.

After his retirement in 1974, Sonenshein lived in Fairfax, Virginia. He moved to Moraga,
California less than a decade later and became assistant to the president of Global Marine
Development, Inc., in Newport Beach, California. In 1982, he received the American Society
of Naval Engineers' Harold E. Saunders Award, which honors """"an individual whose reputation
in naval engineering spans a long career of notable achievement and influence."""" In 1983,
he was a member of the Marine Board of the Commission on Engineering and Technical Systems
of the National Research Council. During his tenure, the board produced a report,
""""Criteria for the Depths of Dredged Navigational Channels.""""

On July 1, 1984, he was appointed by President Ronald Reagan to a two-year term as one of
eight members of the National Advisory Committee on Oceans and Atmosphere. The Reagan
Administration's choices for the panel membership drew criticism from environmentalists,
who noted that it included no atmospheric scientists.

One of the committee's more controversial reports during his tenure suggested that U.S.
shipyards be allowed to go out of business rather than be propped up by government
subsidy. The report, released July 16, 1985, concluded that the country's shipyard
capacity is """"considerably greater"""" than would be required in a major conventional war.
Using classified Pentagon studies, the report concluded that shipyards could expand
production by 3 1/2 to six times, providing all the new ships that would be needed. """"Look
at England in the Falklands"""", Sonenshein told the Washington Post. """"In less than two
months, they were able to modify and convert some 50 of their merchant ships that were
then used for naval operations...Sure, it's always better to have more shipyards and more
merchant ships to give you a margin of safety. But the hard question is, are you going to
pay for it? I wouldn't pay for any more than we now have."""" [1]

Sonenshein died at Kaiser Permanente in San Rafael, California, aged 85. He was buried at
Oakmont Cemetery in Lafayette, California.

He is survived by a daughter, Carol Sonenshein Manashil, a son, William Sonenshein and
three grandchildren: Sarah Irving, Thomas Allen King and Elizabeth Manashil.

"Interesting study on false convictions and rape 

Rapes of white women by black men account for well under 10 percent
of all rapes in the United States, but half of all rape exonerations fall in that
category.
30
This stark disparity suggests that prosecutions of interracial rapes
with black defendants are particularly error prone, perhaps because—as
many psychological studies show—white Americans are much more likely to
mistake one African-American stranger for another than to do so with
members of their own race.

Request For Mediation In Removing Mclellan and The Marine Corps From Manookian's Page [Armenian Issues]
I have tried to informally resolve the editing issues on Arman Manookian to no avail. As a matter of fact, I requested mediation with no response. Moreover, a consensus of Assisting Editors informed me, when I tried to include Arman Manookian on the List of Historically Notable Marines, that Arman Manookian was merely a clerk and nothing more and did not warrant such inclusion and was not part of Marine Corps History. Based on that guidance, I deleted references to McClellan [a Marine Corps Historian] on Manookain's page. Now, I note, the very same editors who opined that Manookian did not warrant inclusion on the List of Historically Notable Marines, insist on including McClellan's name and the Marine Corps on Manookian's page for propaganda purposes. I have repeatedly pointed out that this type of inclusion detracts from Manookian's accomplishments independent of the United States Marine Corps History. It appears as though a double and convoluted standard applies and it is very offensive to Armenians. Moreover, 3 linked references to McClellan and the Marine Corps confuse the readers as to who really the article is about. Is it about Manookian or Mclellan or the United States Marine Corps? Although I am assuming Good Faith, several witnesses are absolutely dismayed at this type of conduct and it should be noted that it gives the appearance of Bias for a POV and propaganda. I don't believe Mediation is consistent with an Editing War. Moreover, as I stated before in assuming Good Faith, it appears as though Manookian's page is being collaborated to sell art and recruit for the Marine Corps. Yet when simple solutions are offered, such as including Manookian and McClellan on the List of Historically Notable Marines, it is ignored because his last name ends in IAN and the fact that he committed suicide as a self imposed martyr. Despite the fact that on the Editor Assistance page the question posed was not answered and then listed as answered, I followed the guidance of those editors who in essence stated that the reason Manookian was taken off the List of Historically Notable Marines was because he was a clerk and McClellan only said nice things about [his name and fame are intertwined with it [Marine Corps History]] him because he felt sorry that Manookian committed suicide and not because he had anything to do with him being the first Marine Corps historical artist/illustrator. I followed their guidance and hope you follow their guidance as well.  This type of conduct cannot stand and it will be noted or publicized. Moreover, there seems to be a concerted effort by so-called volunteer editors who have a keen eye either on my edits or on Marine Corps History that have a problem with historically notable Marines whose last names end in IAN or who volunteered for suicide missions. Apparently, it has something to do with recruitment of Armenians for Martyrdom during WWII and the Marine Corps' subsequent treacherous conduct of ignoring those very same Armenian American Marines for political and financial reasons. At this point I ask that an administrator watch this page very carefully as it relates to an Armenian American Marine who cannot defend himself from scavengers.   00:44, 10",0

 Characteristic Saffir-Simpson Cat 4 Cyclone Larry Central pressure 920-944 mbar 915! mbar when landfall made Potential damages """"More extensive curtainwall failures with some complete roof structure failure on small residences.

Conclusion Larry is indeed a category 4 cyclone at the very least, unless we are willing to ignore important factors for the sake of 10km/h of confirmed sustained wind.

I already have an article (American) claiming it was Cat 4. It's right [here. However, as you stated earlier, newsgroups are not an authority on the matter, are they? As for my friend , well what can I say to you? You have gone against all sound logic and called me a liar because I can't confirm 10km/h of sustained wind. I'm unsure if you even know what logic is. To you, it's all cold hard data, with stupidty thrown in for free. Your level of intelligence sickens me. You've also failed to note the case for central pressure, which was on par with most Cat 5 storms. What you're proposing is this: 

""""A cyclone that brought about more than the effects and damages of a typical Category 4 storm and that had the Central Pressure of a typical Category 5 storm, is in fact a mere Category 3, simply because it's confirmed/measured sustained winds were 5 knots below the """"cut-off"""" for Category 4.""""

For the rest of you: SS scale uses 1-minute averages. A 1-minute average of 200km/h was RECORDED about 30km north of where the cyclone crossed. I understand this is 10km/h less than the cut off for cat 4 (as stated above), but at least it puts estimates and what-nt to rest. Further, I'll leave the rest of my argument to logic, that is, if you have any.

 The lies in how he built the clock

""""His father, Mohamed Elhassan Mohamed, said that on Monday morning, September 14, 2015, he drove his son to school and encouraged him to display his technological ability.[4]

In an interview on Al Jazeera's Ali Velshi on Target, Mohamed said the clock was """"built from scrap around the house"""" and that """"some of the boards were already manufactured.""""[5] He told Larry Wilmore on The Nightly Show that it took him """"10 or 20 minutes"""" to put it together and that he has built more complicated items, but that the clock was simple, using some parts that were scrapped off so that it was easier.[6] According to the initial report in The Dallas Morning News, he had done this """"before bed on Sunday. [September 13, 2015]""""[7]""""

Nowhere is there a paragraph underneath that should write """"While Ahmed claims he built the clock from """"scrap"""", it is well known among tech enthusiasts that it is simply the components of a digital clock with no cover. So what I'm asking, is it alright to add sources that show he was lying? 

Lie 1: Some of the boards were already manufactured - should be """"All of the boards...""""

 Other side 

I heard that Hebrew means from the other side, other side referring to the other side of the Euphrates. But I don't understand from which side one must look, the mediterranean side or the Iranian side if you will. Can someone help me?  

Well, in which language? the Hebrew word for hebrew, Ivrit,does not mean from the other side in hebrew.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 70.107.53.54   

The Hebrew name for Hebrew, """"Ivrit"""", is derived from """"Ivrim"""" (the Hebrew word for """"Israelites"""") meaning simply """"the language of the Israelites"""". Neither word means """"side"""". However, both of these words are constructed from the root consonants ע (/ʕ/,), ב (/v/) and ר (/r/). This means that they may be etymologically related to words such as /ever/ (""""side""""), /ma'avar/ (""""passage""""), /avar/ (""""to pass"""", v.i. or """"to go over""""), /he'evir/ (""""to pass"""", v.t.) and others. As far as I remember, it is traditionally said that the Israelites' name """"Ivrim"""" was given to them because they entered the promised land of Israel by crossing, e.i. passing over the Jordan River.

 biography of Lazar Kaganovich 

a Nice read from a fascinating book for those who deny Kaganovich is one of the worst mass murderers in history and edit it my post defending him. Maybe some information can be added to the page?

Lazar Kaganovich, one of the bloodiest of the communist butchers during the 1930s and 1940s and the number-two man in the Kremlin for many years. 

The book is The Wolf of the Kremlin, and it was written by Stuart Kahan, an American Jew who is Kaganovich's nephew. Kahan went to the Soviet Union in 1981 and interviewed his uncle extensively  in Yiddish  to write this biography, and it is a goldmine of revelations.

To sum it up, Lazar Kaganovich was a Jew raised in the Jewish tradition, a yeshiva boy taught to guide himself on the basis of doing always what is best for the Jews, and this precept actually is cited explicitly several times in the book. He attended his first Communist Party meeting in 1911, when he was 18, to hear the Jewish communist Trotsky give a speech in a synagogue in Kiev; that's right: in a synagogue. He rose rapidly in the inner circle of the Communist Party. His success was due primarily to his aggressiveness and his ruthlessness. In his communist activity he held back from nothing, no matter how brutal or bloody. He even killed his fellow Jews when they got in his way. He was a gangster among gangsters.

In 1930 Kaganovich organized a special department of the Soviet secret police, with himself as the head. It was referred to as the department of """"wet affairs,"""" with """"wet"""" meaning """"bloody."""" That is, it handled clandestine mass executions, of the sort carried out later at Vinnitsa in Ukraine and at Katyn in Russia and at a thousand other places throughout the Soviet Union over the next two decades. Kaganovich became the commissar in charge of mass murder. Yet when the German Army invaded the Soviet Union in 1941, it was Kaganovich who was the savior of the Jews: he arranged for the evacuation of all Jews from the frontier areas and their resettlement far to the east, where they would be safe from the Germans. Let the Ukrainians and the Russians bear the brunt of the German invasion, but protect the Jews from hardship and danger at any cost.

When the Gentile communist Nikita Khruschev accused Kaganovich in 1957 at a Soviet Party Congress of having murdered 20 million Russians during his career, Kaganovich didn't even deny it. He only accused Khruschev of being a murderer too. """"Your hands are blood-stained too,"""" Kaganovich told him. Khruschev pointed out that the difference was that he, Khruschev, had merely followed Kaganovich's orders, while it had been Kaganovich who had formulated the policies of mass murder and had given the orders for carrying out those policies.

As I said, it's a fascinating book, this biography of Lazar Kaganovich, and if you really want to gain some insight into his mentality, you should read it for yourself. 

Kaganovich wants to boast about the power he once held, and at the same time he wants to evade responsibility for his crimes, and one can see this ambivalent attitude throughout the book.

Yours,

Thanks for your very helpful comments. Yiddish authors belonging to the postwar generation who have published one or more books include: Alexander Belousov, Sholem Berger, Leybl Botwinik, Velvl Chernin, Gennadi Estaikh, Mikhoel Felzenbaum, Daniel Galay, Moyshe Lemster, Yitskhok Niborski, Boris Karloff (pen name of Dov-Ber Kerler), Heershadovid Menkes (pen name of Dovid Katz), Boris Sandler, Dmitry Yakirevich. Please note, however, that not all of them were included in the recently suggested revision. 

As for the even younger authors, Yisroel Nekrasov is widely published in literary periodicals in Israel, USA and Russia and his first book collection is scheduled to appear within next few weeks in Moscow (selections of his original poetry can be read in the online magazine """"Der Bavebter Yid"""" and on . Boris Kotlerman's original prose was published in two major Yiddish literary periodicals in Israel (at least twice in each one of them). Haike Beruriah Wiegand's poetry appeared in """"Bavebter Yid"""" and soon in """"Yerusholaimer Almanakh"""" in Jerusalem (see a small selection of her highly sophisticated verse at ). Perhaps a special case could be made for retaining their names in this entry for it is not all that easy for a contemporary Yiddish author to publish her or his work in a separate book no matter how well known and well received that work might be among contemporary Yiddish readers. A case in point is Alexander Belousov whose work was extremely well known and widely acclaimed, but whose first and so far the only collection of works appeared posthumously in 2006. 

Finally, and for the record, there are also two Yiddish poets (and Yiddish scholars), Gilles Rosier in Paris and Thomas Soxberger in Vienna who are also accomplished and well published novelistsin in French and German respectively.

Once again, many, many thanks for your very helpful and constructive comments.

Somehow you and I seem to have developed an unproductive relationship. I do think that your edits are good faith even though I disagree that the most recent ones should be included, yet I can't often assume good faith with your talk page edits. To accuse an editor of having ulterior motives, dismissing arguments as """"simplistic opinion"""", or accusing them of outright ignorance is generally regarded as disruptive, and to accuse Peripitus (one of the most level-headed editors I have come across) of the same things is completely unreasonable. You clearly have considerable passion for Marble Hill, but please remember what the purpose of Wikipedia is. There are plenty of ways you can contribute positively to the article without resorting to unreliable sources for which you have a clear conflict of interest.

A rivalry requires that there be more than 1 side competing (for whatever) - if this """"rivalry"""" is """"basically unacknowledged"""" by Caltech, then I would suggest that terming it as a rivalry is quite PoV. Are there any corrobrating sources that aren' from HMC, or is this literally a case of HMC students saying """"we're rials"""", and Caltech saying there is no rivalry? If the latter, changes need to be made.

"""Alternate Kanji==

It translates to “sensei”? It’s pronounced that way, but it translates (into English, at any rate) as “ancient sage” and usually refers to Confucius. But it has absolutely nothing to do with the word covered by this article, and the kanji are not alternates for 先生. The coincidence of pronunciation is just that: a coincidence. Nothing more, nothing less.   

I'm only asking if the kanji I listed is a archic version of the current kanji used. Plus, Confucius was a teacher so it can't be said mere coincidence.  

Suite yourself. But 先聖 is not an archaic version of 先生, and the coincidence of pronunciation is just that. This is not at all a rare phenomenon in Japanese; in fact, it is the Chinese that you should be tracking down. Whether 先聖 and 先生 are pronounced the same in Chinese, I do not know. In any case, if you introduce into the article your assumption about the two character strings being related or variant “spellings” of the same word, you will have to substantiate the assertion with a reliable source as per WP:ATT.

Thanks for the support... by the time you added that comment I'd changed the tautology para, and removed all the others so I'm not clear which """"current"""" para you mean. Quite a lot of consilidation done tonight; I'm much happier with the current text than before. From my POV the main remaining problem is the lead paragraph which I hope the current text demonstates is seriously misleading. Here is my proposed new version:

In physics and cosmology, the anthropic principle was originally the rule of reasoning that we should take account of the constraints that our existence as observers imposes on the sort of universe that we could observe. The term has since been extended to cover supposed """"superlaws"""" that in various ways require the universe to support intelligent life, usually assumed to be carbon-based, and occasionally to be specifically human beings. Anthropic reasoning involves assessing these constraints by analysing the properties of universes with different fundamental parameters or laws of physics from ours, and has frequently concluded that essential structures, from atomic nuclei to the whole universe, depend for stability on delicate balances between different fundamental forces; balances which only occur in a small minority of possible universes — so that ours seems to be  fine-tuned for life. Anthropic reasoning also attempts to explain and quantify this fine tuning. Within the scientific community the usual approach is to invoke selection effects from a real ensemble of alternate universes; competing strategies, occasionally also called anthropic, include intelligent Design. 
 
This would allow some shortening of the second para discussing controversies. You can see that I plan to have Anthropic reasoning re-direct to this page.  You can also see that I think we should avoid getting hung up on the tautologous nature of some statements of the AP (including the one you like), because I do think that misses the point.(c.f. new first para to the Character of Anthropic reasoning section). Oh, another proposal: merge the Bostrom section into the Variants, i.e. add his self sampling assumption as an AP-type statement. What do you think?  """,0

 The following is based on personal speculation so, once again, feel free to correct me if I get this wrong.

 While there are some surface similarities between racial hygiene and ethnic cleansing, I believe that the concept of racial hygiene did not play a major role in the expulsions documented in this article.

 The major unique feature of racial hygiene is the concept of race and genetics (eugenics).  This concept argues that you are who you are by dint of your parents race and genetics and that what you think and how you act is irrelevant to the """"pollution"""" caused by your inferior genes.  Thus, Hitler could argue for an Aryan super-race that was polluted by Jewish, Slavic and other inferior races.  If you had any forebears from a non-Aryan race, you were suspect.

 In contrast, ethnic cleansing is more about removing those of a different ethnicity where ethnicity is usually marked by language, religion and customs.  Those considered to be a different ethnicity might be of the same race (e.g. Hutus and Tutsis in Rwanda).  It is hard to argue that Poles and Germans are of different races unless you are a Nazi.  To most people, they are just different ethnicities of the Caucasian race.  It is similarly hard to argue that the various ethnic groups (Serbs, Croats, Bosnians) in the the former Yugoslavia are of different races.  As far as I know, the major differences are language and religion.

 As a thought experiment, consider the case of a German woman married to a Polish man in the first half of the 20th century.  If the family spoke Polish at home and raised their children as Poles (i.e. Polish-speaking Catholics), would that family have been expelled?  I doubt it.  If you agree, then you can see that the expulsions of ethnic Germans may have been motivated by ethnic cleansing but not by racial hygiene.

 Hope that helps.

 Skepticism regarding the existence of ISIS 

Hi there.  Perhaps I'm behind the times though I do try to keep up with the """"news"""" and with """"global"""" events, but, I get the feeling that ISIS does not really exist.  Just as there is an excellent chance that Al-Qaeda does not really exist.  I was especially inspired to post this comment when I saw in the first paragraph of this article use the neologism """"jihadist"""".  It doesn't take much brain power to know that there is no one in the world, besides maybe a few deeply stupid solo acts who keep up with thew western media, who refer to themselves as """"jihadists"""".  That is a habit of english speaking people to combine two words from different languages -in this case, arabic and english.  Similarly, there is no centralized organization known as the Taliban, no organization or action known as """"Islamist"""" no organization known as al-Qaeda.  Notice also, that even the purported mission of """"ISIS"""" is not Islamic in its nature.  I know what folks want to ask: then how is it that words like jihadist, islamist, taliban, al-qaeda, and ISIS exist?  Its called orientailsim.  The Palestinian scholar Edward Said wrote extensively on the history of english speaking people, and other imperialists, who purposely attack and misrepresent Muslim peoples.  It started with the Crusades.  I don't mean to be a no it all, but ought we just believe what we are told?  Is there a way to find empirical evidence that they do exist?  If they do exist -what are we talking about?  A few people who never studied Shariah in the first place.   10 August, 2014""",0

 Answer to my question re: web site for both sides controversial issues 

I'm interested in a wide range of issues.  I tend to be liberal politically and enjoy discussing issues with some conservative friends.  On some issues I have made up my mind but would like to understand the other side.  On other issues, I'd like to get more information or at least a good starting point of the the key points of both sides and places to looks further.  going on an issue-by-issue basis is OK but very time consuming. Also, you get a lot of misleading information by looking at sites that promote their point of view. it would be great if there was a web site that had already done this.  Like having an intelligent person research each issue and then give you a one-page summary like """" Here's the issue, here are the two or three main sides, here's the philisophical underpinning for each side, and here are the main points each side makes, backed up by these references.""""

Global warming - Wiki is pretty good

alternative energy policy

The only extent to which I haven't has been me trying to do exactly the same """"Step back and take a deep breath"""" since Monday thing that you're now arguing I should do.

 Complex issue 

 This is quite a complex issue. There have been a few cases around the world where individual officials have solemnised marriages (e.g. France, Greece, Quintana Roo in Mexico). I don't think these jurisdictions should be included in the template, since there is no generalised recognition of same-sex marriage or possibility of generally entering into a legal same-sex marriage. However, what we have in Alagoas seems a bit different. I am prima facie in favour of including Alagoas based on the reasoning of User:Denisxavier. However, before we include Alagoas, we need a bit more information about how Brazilian marriage law works. In particular, I have two questions:

 *When an opposite-sex couple wants to enter into a marriage in Brazil, how do they do it? Are legal marriages registered at a Civil Registry Office, which conducts a civil ceremony and provides the marriage certificate? What is the role of the judge in these marriages? Also, what is a """"Notary""""? Are they a state official working in a Civil Registry Office, or a private person who can register marriages? The issue I am interested in here is: is the process for entering into a same-sex marriage identical to entering into an opposite-sex marriage in Alagoas? Or are there administrative / procedural differences?
 *Are Civil Registry Offices/Notaries obliged to register same-sex marriages in Alagoas, or are they merely allowed to do so? If they are not obliged to do so, then I think it's more problematic to include Alagoas in the template, because it means that the law is not being applied consistently.

 The fact that the highest federal court has not yet ruled on the matter is in my opinion irrelevant. When the Supreme Court of California legalised same-sex marriage in California, we still included it in the template, even if the Supreme Court of the US did not yet give its opinion. Wikipedia is flexible enough that it can accommodate to changing realities; if a superior court strikes down the lower court, then all we need to do is simply change the template again. This has been done a few times already. Cheers, '''''' ✉ """,0

 Terms not concepts 
I think at some point I saw in my watchlist a comment from someone about some kind of term not being a concept.

I am also wondering if you have some special knowledge, perhaps based in some study of philosophy of language or metaphysics, or if this is your general impression?

There are many """"terminology"""" categories, and I basically see them as """"junk"""" categories where articles that are hard to classify end up.

Hello Uketpat Thanks for the notification. I believe however that this article fulfils the criteria for inclusion on wikipedia. You are free to google search on the name of this notable personality who is a source of inspiration to many downtrodden young Africans. An extra-ordinary figure in the democratization of the continent and a major player in the worldwide democratization movement of the late 1980s. We have seen many stories about figures in the democratization struggle of Eastern Europe which are not as compelling as this celebrated in the global media. We read of the heros of Tianamen....this is one of the heroes of the Nigerian struggles that claimed more victims that Tianamen and was languishing in Jail at that same period. A second review will be much appreciated. i left you a message over 4weeks requesting a proof reading to be sure its ok to 'go life' but didn't get a response.,0

""" are deciding which is a relevant cello sonata and what is not. You have decided that the Carter is relevant and the Blackwood sonata is also relevant (I would be surprised if most cellist would even know Blackwood - I happen to like the work) and they belongs in YOUR version of this list. 

This article as well as other similar ones need to be a list arranged by epoch, or other criteria, otherwise it is not accurately titled.(CELLO SONATA - LIST OF CELLO SONATAS) This information needs to be aquired from all source available. Then organized accordingly. Otherwise you are hindering the true potential of Wikipedia. I am sure of this! Specially in the awakening of internet 2 technologies. 

I cannot but agree with the personal promotion issue. But in this case you are making a particular composer the issue. I have many other composers I'd like to ad to this lists and possibly write about - and I would not mind being edited or corrected by the Wikipedia community, but not by ONE person. This cannot possibly be what Wikipedia intended. If it is so, the visionary model would be compromised and lost in long term. 

If information arrives, which is factual, accurate and sourced. Regardless of source. Should it be included? or is it subject to Editorial opinion based control by ONE person. Please answer me this one question.

And, is the Cello Sonata List a list of existing cello sonatas or only of certain Cello Sonatas which an administrator agrees with as relevant? 

All the best wishes,

 DeStella

All righty then.  If you think I'm biased, go ask for another opinion from another administrator.  There's 1200 of us.  Do it.  The list is here:  Wikipedia:List of Administrators.  I'm sure you can find one who is not """"defensive"""" or does not """"have issues with successful composers"""".  Please leave a post on the administrators' noticeboard if you think I am biased.  Do it!  If you truly believe that I am biased, go get another opinion!  And don't accuse me of having """"my version"""" of the cello sonata article, for I have not edited it except to remove your promotion.  I did not write the article.  (talk) 

Dear Antandrus,

You still did not answer my questions )  Which do not relate to the self promotion issue, which of course is clear. I will in the future refrain from adding any information about family members. But, If information arrives, which is factual, accurate and sourced. Regardless of editor. Should it be included? Isn't it a loss to WP? - And, is the Cello Sonata List (and this question applies to all open lists in WP) a list of all existing cello sonatas or only of certain Cello Sonatas to be determined by  administrators? 
In any case, thank you for your time in clarifying a lot about WP and its mechanisms. 

These are relevant quotes from information I have found in WP guideline pages:

""""Lists should always include unambiguous statements of membership criteria based on definitions made by reputable sources. """"

In this scase the list title is LIST OF CELLO SONATAS. So adding any existing and published cello sonatas should be valid unless the listing title is changed to narrow the list. I would suggest adding the criteria to Cello Sonatas that are in print or published. Do you agree?

And, I simply politely ask that if you have a problem with an entry, you tag the sentence or listing by adding the  or use another WP guideline way to allow for the editor to respond. Not simply arbitrarily remove. In particular with lists.

Thank you again for your time and I look forward to becoming more involved in the WP community. Kudos to all involved!

Hi again; thanks for promising to follow our COI guideline:  that's my main issue, as an administrator, with your edit that started this thread.  As an editor I have no problem with you adding or removing names from lists, and I encourage you to improve articles in any way you would like.  Regarding the list of cello sonatasthis is a problematic issue, and has to do with the evolution of Wikipedia.  Within the last couple years most of the embedded lists within articles have been moved to their own articles, but several years ago that was not the case (see the history of Renaissance music and List of Renaissance composers for an example).  Cello sonata is a sadly neglected article and needs a lot of improvement.  Have a look at List of compositions for cello and piano and List of solo cello pieces for two more places some of these things are written up; and I suggest it may be time to split off",0

Too many lies in this para=
In following para, yogindar sikand is a muslim convert and his name is mentioned as Hindu representative. The first statement is a lie as he is not a hindu representative.

Representatives of Hinduism held a variety of views on Muhammad, some with an assertion that the prophet was none else than the Narashansrishi of the Vedas, predicted in the Atharva Veda.[183] One of the prominent Vaishnava proponents, A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada maintained that Mohammad and Jesus, were empowered representatives of God, saktiavesa avataras.[184] In a variety of other points of view, some translated the phrase """"the last prophet"""", suggesting that Vedic deity Agni is none other but Muhammad.[185] In 1926 Siddiq Hussain's two-volume Kannada book, Ja at Guru Sarwar-i 'Alam, argued that the Muhammad was actually Kalki avatar whose arrival had been predicted in the Hindu scriptures, however this view is not a widely accepted doctrine.[186] On the other hand Mirza Ghulani Ahmad argued that Rama and Krishna were prophets of God who had foretold the arrival of Muhammad as God's last law-bearing prophet.[187] Mohammad is sometimes linked to the passage of the Rig Veda declaring that Narashams rishi will arrive as the """"last divine messenger"""" (antim deva duta), who shall """"dispel all darkness"""" and """"conquer death"""".[188]""",0

 Aha! So, it is not about Bessarabia, it is about Soviet demands over Bessarabia. I think this is the core issue of numerous misunderstandings. If we start from analyzing what the Soviets demanded and see that Romania and the west did not made sufficient steps to apease it, we observe insuficient action from the side of Romania (did not organize a referendum), as well as from the west (did not succeed in overthrowing the Reds - to try is not enough). But also we run into Англия, Франция, Италия, Япония и Румыния подписали в Париже т. н. Бессарабский протокол, согласно которому они признали суверенитет Румынии над Бессарабией, и установили, что этот суверенитет """"не может быть поставлен на обсуждение"""", which obviously ties the hands of Romania: whatever you say, it was much more important for Romania to have normal relations with the rest of the world than with Russia.
 But I said from early on, that Bessarabia, not Russia is the center of the issue. It is Bessarabians that chose this or that, not Romania or Russia. Russia had intervened only in 1940, without being invited by a local body or by MPs from Bessarabia, without even a mock support from inside Bessarabia. Why should Russia's demand be treated supperior to Bessarabia's choice (good or bad, it was a choice made in full awareness). The (military) treaty you mention was signed in February, i.e. before 27 March 1918 between two neighboring to Bessarabia countries. It can not possibly tie the hands of Bessarabia itself, by then an independent country.
 About autonomy, as far as I know, after the 27 November, resp. 1 December 1918 union of Bukovina, resp. Transylvania, a government was set for the entire united Romania, led by a Transylvanian politician (Alexandru Vaida-Voevod). He was too liberal for the phanariot-minded politicians that used to govern in Bucharest before. They tolerated """"new Romanians"""" in government only becuse the circumstances made that necessary. Among other things, Vaida started a large campain of land reform, widely supported also by Bukovinians and Bessarabians, but very feared by the old ruling elite in Bucharest (recall the 1907 peasant uprising, still very fresh in mind). They tollerated Vaida's governments (there were 2 or 3 I think) for ca. 1 year, and in early 1920, a """"black coalition"""" was formed, and General Averescu became prime-minister (similar to the one formed in Romania in early 2006 against Basescu, which lamenably failed within 1 month, but dragged the country more into politicianist discourse until last autumn). Land reform was limited and only went as far as to finish what was started. The new Constitution of 1923 was written by these people, who put the word """"unitary"""" everywhere they could fit it into. Thus the autonomy of all three new provinces was not enshrined in the new Constitution. In return that led to a bitter division of the politics: on one side National-Liberal party of Bucharest old politicians, on the other the Transylvanian-dominated National-Ţărănist party. In 1928-1930, the latter started to gain momentum, and to sealed it they brought in Carol II from forced exile. But Carol II turned to be even worse, so they actually shut themselves into leg, so to say. That led some of them to more nationalistic discurse (for example Vaida himself - Dahn even calls him fascist, which is not true, but I don't want to argue with Dahn), others managed to escape this trap (for example Maniu). You see, you have to take into consideration the entire going ons. Bessarabia was left without regional autonomy because no other province got it, which in turn was because the old phanariot-mineded people carried the day in early 1920s. These people lost the grip on power, but it took time. Even in modern Romania you still have the continuation of the same disputes. On one side you have many politicians asking for setting up regions and more local autonomy (again, surprisingly many Transylvanians among them), on the other side you have the command-system-minded partly-communist-foprmed bureaucracy, who fear regionalization (again, surprizingly many Oltenians and other likes of them among). But unlike the interbelic period, it seem that now the movement is strictly oriented in one direction. Regionalization and greater local autonomy is inevitable, whether you bring the EU-standard pretext or not. So, my second part of the answer is: if it were not for the Soviet occupation, the rise of fascism, and WWII, we would have had autonomy for Bessarabia (with a powerful local legislative body) by 1950s. Communism only created a pause, things continue to roll today. \talk """,0

Review
 With this work, the authors, Mayoury and Pheuiphanh Ngaosyvathn, offer us a wealth of information on the history of a small kingdom, the Lao, centered at Vientiane, in modern Laos, caught between expanding core states (Burma, Thailand, and Vietnam) in the late eighteenth- and early nineteenth century. The authors draw upon a wide literature and an impressive range of languages to present a clear and careful picture of a very complex period in Lao and Southeast Asian history.

This book is really the story of Chou Anou, the last of the Lao kings of Vientiane and his struggle against rivals on all sides. Chou Anou played a political game between the expansionist Thai and Vietnamese states in the late eighteenth and ear]y nineteenth centuries, a game that his kingdom eventually lost. Because of the Tay Son, Vietnam was out of the picture for decades; the central Thai court was Chou Anou's chief antagonist. When Vietnam does enter the picture again under Minh Mang, it is as a supporter of Chou Anou, in the context of a larger Thai-Vietnamese competitive hostility. Fighting between Thailand and Vientiane appears on an extremely personal level in the text — the authors stressing at one point Rama III's anxiety that a massacre of Vietnamese emissaries and Lao guides by a Thai officer had not left enough dead, considering an earlier massacre of Thai by Chou Anou in Vientiane (p. 242); they stress also the personal nature of the fighting between Chou Anou and the Thai general Bodin. Further, the text seems almost to replicate, anachronistically, aspects of war more endemic to the post-World-War II conflicts in Indochina, including a reference to """"sophisticated Siamese psychological operations"""" (p. 212).

Paths to Conflagration is organized into nine chapters, each covering a different episode of the period, examined step-by-step, and turns from one incarnation of Vientiane to another — from victim to provocateur to buffer state. Each page is heavy with documentation, but the narrative is lighter. This book has three real strengths. First, it discusses history at the point of intersection between three different polities and does not apply the nation-state """"cookie-cutter"""" approach — looking only at developments as they relate to a state-centered narrative (thus framed by political borders). Instead of the history of Laos, we find here the history of a very turbulent period in which political borders did not mean very much in delineating the boundaries of action. Second, this book makes use of a very wide range of sources, especially from the Thai archives, spanning a large number of languages (including Lao, Thai, Vietnamese, Chinese, French, English, and German — both primary sources and secondary literature) and a multitude of perspectives. Third, this book focuses attention on developments sometimes left out of analyses of mainland Southeast Asian history, such as the all-important impact of migration, especially in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. It is no mistake that migration is referred to over and over again in chronicles of the period, from western Burma to Vietnam, and that migration is used as metaphor for political change and state reformation for far earlier periods in these chronicles. Here too, migration played a very important role, as the authors stress both migration into the Lao kingdom, and forcible expulsion by the Thais, as a basis for the well-being and even survival of the Vientiane-based state.

"Hank Zipzer- Barfing in the Back Seat
Hank Zipzer is a fifth grader who consistently gets in trouble and has learning difficulties. In this book, Hank’s dad, Stanley Zipzer, raced into the room where the Zipzer family was sitting. Excited he exclaimed, “Road trip!” He was so happy that he knocked over the Raisin Bran Hank was eating. Fortunately, Cheerio, their dog, consumed the spilled cereal; the Zipzer family never needed to clean up anything since they got Cheerio. Hank asked if they had to come as well with Stan and Randi Zipzer, Hank’s parents. Emily, who always liked to answer people’s questions explained that they would never let them stay home with the TV remote and microwave dinners. The only reason dad wanted to go on a road trip was because there was a crossword puzzle tournament; Hank’s dad loved crossword puzzles and when he saw one, he never took his eyes of it. The only things Hank could say were wow, oh wow and wowee wow wow wow. Mum promises that they would go to a theme park, called Colossus Coaster Kingdom. They were also allowed to bring one special guest of their choice along with them. Emily chooses Katherine, her iguana, and Hank chooses Frankie Townsend. 
Ms Adolf gives Hank a homework packet which has nine-hundred pages and Hank cannot go on any of the rides until he finishes all of his homework. They are all allowed to choose a place to stop at. Dad picked a library. Emily and Katherine choose the science museum. Frankie Townsend picks a basketball court. Mum chooses a honey farm and Hank chooses the theme park. Dad looked at the library, Emily studied the museum, mum looked the farm and they went to a hotel where Hank loses his homework; Frankie had to give up twenty pounds and his trip to the court just to save Hank. Hank doesn’t finish his homework on time and cannot go on any of the rides; he had to watch his dad complete all his crossword puzzles. Mr Zipzer becomes one of the top five people who participated. Everyone didn’t complete the puzzle in the time that was given. First place was Martina Stone from Cheyenne, Wyoming. Second place was HANK’S DAD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Bugging America

The Liberties of the Subject

By WERTHER

The overwhelming balance of recorded history has been marked by despotism. When homo sapiens sapiens transitioned from hunter gatherer to agriculturalist, he gained literacy, solid dwellings, and other accoutrements of what is commonly considered civilization. But he experienced a sharp decline in personal liberty.

The reasons for this are commonsensical. Disputes between tribes of hunter gatherers could be resolved by one or the other simply pulling up stakes and relocating to a new territory, there being few material impedimenta to prevent them. A settled agricultural existence, on the other hand, implied permanent villages, granaries, and land boundaries to be defended against depredation. The need for defenses implied a national security state. Agricultural surpluses not only necessitated armed defense, but allowed a division of labor leading to policemen, soldiers, bureaucrats, and tax assessors, the latter of whom would confiscate a percentage of the harvest.

The evolution of labor conditions also implied a different mental outlook. The hunter gatherer was an independent contractor (if not brigand) who ranged over extensive territory and worked alone or in small groups. The agricultural laborer, by contrast, toiled in one spot, making his comings and goings more subject to regulation.

If the land was not his, he became dependent on the Big Man's favor. Given the increased population densities in regions where agricultural societies developed, he could only rarely strike out on his own: the good land had been already taken, and game animals cleared or hunted to local extinction. [1]

With the rise of what Karl Wittfogel call """"hydraulic civilization,"""" [2] the screw of oppression turned once again against personal liberty. In order to build the extensive earthworks necessary for the state to survive the next drought or flood, the rulers of these proto-superpowers subjected their subjects to enforced toil and off-duty regimentation which rendered them no more free than so many draft animals.

It is unlikely the rulers of the states in the Valley of Mexico, the Nile, the Euphrates, the Ganges, or the Yang-Tze had much toleration for the complaints their subjects, who were enslaved, enserfed, or otherwise regimented for the greater good as defined by the states' rulers. These complaints, had they been permitted, would have constituted freedom of speech.

Nor would the rulers have given credence to a peasant's assertion that the interior of his crude dwelling, and the contents thereof, were inviolate from the inquisitiveness of the state. He, the peasant, simply had no rights a ruler was bound to respect (to paraphrase what a former Supreme Court Justice once said about slaves in a famous ruling in 1857); the only limit on a ruler's power over his subjects was the former's fear of rebellion should discontent overflow.

Of the two rights discussed thus far, freedom of speech and freedom from arbitrary search and seizure, the latter is fundamentally more important to human beings' maintaining a status above that of mere hive animals. This is not intended in any way to disparage the desirability and necessity of free speech. But there are practical circumstances when free speech is not exercised by reasonable peopledue to reticence, shame, or its merely being not worth the effort. Or when one is married.

Much obnoxious and exhibitionistic behavior is rationalized as free speech, while more urgent matters are suppressed: how many hourly employees feel free to say what they really think of their supervisors, and is the resultant lawsuit really covered by the First Amendment? But asinine reality TV blares on. Out of politeness or discretion, most intelligent people censor their opinions about politics, in-laws, bosses, and religion when they are in the public commons.

The inviolability of one's person, and one's dwelling, is more basic. What would the average person resent more: being told he cannot ask questions of the President of the United States at a staged event, or being ordered to be strip searched in public? Or, for that matter, have his house ransacked? That is the principle at issue. The lesser freedom is essential for political discourse, the greater freedom distinguishes us from dogs. [3]

Respect for privacy, for oneself and one's fellow citizens, is the benchmark of a sense of an individual self. The majority of psychologically well adjusted people believes that there are facts and circumstances about them that just do not bear the glaring searchlight of public revelation.

Other Asian References  This Matsuda tour also went to Indonesia and I can find almost indecipherable references on what looks like Indonesian google and wikipedia. But while researching the topic, I discovered why his appearance in the 1990 Disney movie Newsies was so notable.  He is chinese and his appearance in the movie became a milestone in that he was an Asian playing in a non-stereotyped role. As an early role model for Asian actors, I can see that there ia a hollywood social group called """"Team Yellow"""" and they seem to all be friends and have dinners once a year. But beyond discussion on social sites, I fear I cannot find news material on this topic. A further Asian reference, that also involves his modelling career, is that he is the model used in Photographer David LaChappelle's current exposition on Chinese Pop Culture and Bruce Lee which opened in Hong Kong just last month. There is a video on his site of David LaCapelle making these works, and the David LaChapelle site on the Hong Kong Show has the pieces available for online viewing. However, I don't think links to the video and a viewing of the show pieces is enough and would have to find news articles about the show in Hong Kong journals. As I continue researching this article I am truly impressed by the vast variability in this man's career.   Gmccombs""",0

 Strength training 

Hi,

You removed a bunch of text from the strength training article (the 'common concerns' section).  I reverted your edit, and this is to let you know why.  You said in your edit summary """"deleting copyvio from http://www.tranquillizer.co.uk/weight-training-concerns.html"""" - if you look at that page, you can see at the end of some statements, there are numbers thus """"[17]"""".  The tranquillizer site actually copied the information from wikipedia, not the other way around.  Its not a copyvio from us, it's a copy vio from them.  Just a head's up.

 

Sounds like you think the section's biggest problem is the tone of the section rather than the section itself.  I'd agree with that, I'll try for a re-write if I have time in the near future.

 Sitush you are a menace to Wikipedia as this conversation from the page of another editor shows - Are you a 15 year old kid trying his hand in editing academic articles??? 

First Lilit Shastri writes to Jonathan. This is because Sitush has just vandalized his article about Singahi Bhiraura and reduced it to four or five lines, via numerous reverts, here is the letter. Later you will see that  Sitush interjects and gives some lousy reasons for his numerous reverts to the article which are academically illogical, but  ever trigger happy with the revert button Sitush|talk]] goes about his business as master referee. Its the same story with other articles Sitush has edited on Wikipedia. Some long standing editors have got impatient with him.

Dear Jonathan

I agree with WP:OR but if you read the sources on the article carefully and compare it with the guidelines to quote """"The prohibition against OR means that all material added to articles must be attributable to a reliable published source, even if not actually attributed""""

Here is the list of attributable reliable sources of the article which were republished and meet the guidelines:

There are Papers from the AN Seely Collection: This a a British Library Publication 1972, which is a reputable Publishing House. AN Seely the author was a fellow of Trinity College Oxford, and a scholar in Persian Studies. He compiled these from the original sources and they were published.

Title: Caste in the Subah of Oudh Army by AN Seely Collection Area: India Office Records and Private Papers Reference: IOR/L/MIL/14/223 Creation Date: 1890-1895 Extent and Access: Extent: 1 volume The India Office Records are the repository of the archives of the East India Company (1600-1858), the Board of Control or Board of Commissioners for the Affairs of India (1784-1858), the India Office (1858-1947), the Burma Office (1937-1948), and a number of related British agencies overseas. The focus of the India Office Records is in the territories now included in India, Pakistan, Burma and Bangladesh and their administration before 1947. The Records also include source materials for neighbouring or connected areas at different times, covering not only South Asia, but also Southeast Asia, Central Asia, the Middle East, and parts of Africa. The official archives of the India Office Records are complemented by over 300 collections and over 3000 smaller deposits of private papers relating to the British experience in India. The India Office Records are administered by The British Library as part of the Public Records of the United Kingdom, and are open for public consultation.
Title: Caste in the Subah of Oudh Army, AN Seely Collection Area: India Office Records and Private Papers Reference: IOR/L/MIL/14/223 Creation Date: 1890-1895 Extent and Access: Extent: 1 volume
Title: Pasi, Chamar and Low Caste caste,under Brahmin Land ownership ,Oudh Collection Area: India Office Records and Private Papers Reference: IOR/Z/E/4/25/C516 Creation Date: 1854-1855 Extent and Access: Extent: 1 entry Related Resources: See entry at IOR/E/4/825, p986

NOW HERE SITUSH GIVES HIS CLASSIC REASON FOR DESTROYING THIS ACADEMIC ARTICLE. ITS CLEAR THE FELLOW HAS NOT HAD ANY RESEARCH EXPERIENCE OR AUTHORED ANY ACADEMIC WORK 

It doesn't matter who published the papers: the underlying content is primary material. For example, there have been similar issues regarding the works of Henry Miers Elliot, who basically reproduced ancient Indian texts. I know some members of the Seely family, as it happens, but diaries, letters, office reports etc are not reliable sources. Someone needs to write a book about them, not a book containing them. Furthermore, Raj sources generally are not deemed to be reliable, and especially not for matters of caste and history. - Sitush (talk) 

""""(The above is classic Sitush)""""

MY COMMENTS REGARDING SITUSH'S REMARKS

Sitush you are an ass. I do not know who let you loose on Wikipedia, NCRT textbooks are writtin from the sources in the India Office Archive. Every historical work including that of Seely depends to some extent on primary sources that work has been published and the authors of the Singahi article have cited from it. These are spurious and non academic grounds of objecting to the article. Its just making mischief, I invite anybody from a higer academic background to examine all Sitush Sitush (talk) edits.

Examining Sitush|talk]]) edits all over Wikipedia as I have done establishes he is a menace and taking wikipedia backwards. Sitush I suspect you are just a 14 year old kid treating wikipedia as a toy.

I think there's a fundamental disconnect with this article and it starts with piece on lambda calculus. There is need of a bridge between the historical work and computing languages: Ada Byron developed some notation for the algorithmic computing, so programming paradigms should trace back at least to her. In 1963, John McCarthy wrote a seminal paper A basis for a mathematical theory of computation found In Computer Programming and formal systems. North-Holland. McCarthy's paper is a bridge from what we have today and the Church, Turing, Kleene work. McCarthy's basic argument was that recursive functions were the natural setting. Denotational semantics is the natural outgrowth of McCarthy's ideas by way of Strachey and Scott.",0

You're talking to the wrong guy. Not only did I not start any editwars. I didn't initiate any personal attacks either, I used the talk page the way it is supposed to be utilized, to initiate discussion on the subject of an influential person to the Church of the SubGenius. Someone who at bare minimum is a church in-joke and at maximum had a chilling effect on a number of the members. I suppose you are off to edit DooM out of the article on the Columbine Killings as it was released several years before the killings happened and there is no direct causal relationship between it and the killings, only people who claim there is a causal link. Kevin Underwood affected the church. Nearly every member of note has an opinion on the booger, and all you have to do is mention Underwood on the talk page to get swarmed by Church member caretakers and hack attacks (a variety of these have taken place in the last few days while discussing editing the article, from blocking of the page entirely, to abnormal (10 minutes or more) page load times, to apparent deletion of talk points after loading the page.) What you have here is a page zealously defended by a bunch of nuts who are so zealous about their complete disassociation from Underwood despite comments by Church co-creator Ivan Stang regarding him AND conversations with him, that the protestations are evidence themselves of his effect on the Church. That said, notice I haven't made any edits on the article. Just responded on the talk page to your unjust accusations. Far politer than was deserved. 71.102.18.173",0

See, that's always the way I'd considered it, too (although I'm a Catholic who supports Liverpool). However, the debate still rages fiercely - I used to work at Radio Merseyside on the Roger Phillips phone-in, and it would crop up all the time. As soon as one person said on the phone that Everton were always the Catholic club, you'd get twenty people phoning in to say they were the Protestant club. It's such a fervent debate that there's really just not the space it needs on the Wikipedia entry, and surely the fact that there's even a debate shows that the religious affiliations of the two clubs aren't as ingrained in their existence as those of Rangers and Celtic - as such, I don't think it's necessary to include it.  14:47",0

I'm not so much a proponent of my own version so much as an *opponent* of the use of the meaningless (to the non-mathematical) word """"instantaneous.""""

I don't really mind the differentiation thing being right after the initial sentence, because people might have clicked on the derivative page after going to differentiation (a disambig page).  It's certainly grammatical to say """"Finding a derivative is called differentiation""""; see gerund.  However, now that I think about it, maybe we should just say """"Differentiation is the process of finding a derivative.""""  (We put the sentence in the active voice.)

"If you remove this article OK, but still I doubt that you catch the most general aspect of curvature in the sense of Nomizu, Kulkarni and other modern writers. Look at the reference  where you find more references. In the references there (look also that one in Lecture Notes in Mathematics) you find a decomposition of the space of all curvature structures in terms of Lie and Jordan algebras. And you find how elegantly electrodynamics and gravitational waves fit into the curvature play, look at the basic work of Lichnerowics. As an ,algebraiker' I like to write the curvature structure in the following triple form, generalizing the concept of Lie triples (the book of Otmar Loos is a nice generalization of Lie theory):
[x,y,z]=R(x,y)z. This concept generalizes the notion of a Lie triple to that one of a curvature triple, where only the Jacobiidentity is missing, but a reference to the bilinear form <,> is added in such a way, that R(x,y) is an element of the pseudoorthogonal Lie algebra. Note that the complete work of Ricci, Einstein and Weyl can be summarized as a decomposition of the space of curvature structures of Levi type (for Lie algebras). All this shows, that we do not yet understand this curvature space completely. Especially the gravitational wave aspect needs clarification. Hannes Tilgner",0

"Example Citation 

For the paragraph:

Some judges are also known to rule against precedent on principle. A judge (or even an interim appeal court) may rule against a precedent that is outdated. The judge may feel the decision needs to be overturned due to more sophisticated legal reasoning. Such a judge may wish to help the law evolve by ruling against precedent and thereby indirectly inducing a losing party to appeal. The appeal court will then have an opportunity to review the lower court's decision and may adopt the lower court's reasoning, thereby overturning previous case law. This may also happen several times as the case works its way through intermediate appellate jurisdictions.

Would it be an idea to provide an example? A world-famous example is the Warren court's overturning of Plessy v. Ferguson in Brown v. Board of Education.",0

Opening Bias 

In the opening segment (If that's what you call it - I mean the first content, before the table of contents), there is the following paragraph:

The conflict killed at least 1,200 people, mostly Lebanese citizens,[38][39][40] severely damaged Lebanese civil infrastructure, and displaced approximately one million Lebanese[41] and 300,000–500,000 Israelis.[26][42][43] After the ceasefire, some parts of southern Lebanon remained uninhabitable due to Israeli unexploded cluster bomblets.[44]

It is blatantly obvious how anti-Israeli this paragraph is. The information might be true, and there is some doubt as to whether it actually is, but the way in which it is organized, especially in the opening segment, is ridiculously biased. A reader would probably read it whilst skimming the article, as it is the shortest paragraph in the opening segment, and then get the following information: Israel killed many Lebanese citizens; Lebanese civil infrastructure, which means hospitals, roads, etc., was destroyed by Israel, Israel displaced twice as much Lebanese civilians, and they used cluster bombs which render some Lebanese area uninhabitable.

Completely biased. Completely anti-Israeli. Completely ridiculous. Completely unacceptable of a Wikipedia article, especially a """"good"""" article.

I recommend either changing the wording (Maybe removing 'mostly Lebanese citizens', 'Lebanese', and changing it to approximately 1.5 million people displaced, as well as completely omitting the last sentence). The entire paragraph could be removed entirely, with some of the more important information being integrated to other paragraphs.

There were two main reasons why I closed: The solid arguments WP:SALAT and WP:NOT#DIRECTORY. """"Keep - but remove red links"""" isn't really a solid rationale; it didn't really address the two arguments above. The second keep was stronger, but again didn't really address the points above, and was more along the lines of WP:OTHERSTUFFEXISTS.

On the counter side of that argument, redlinks show potential for new articles, but when there are so many redlinks, there is no need for such a list. There were many items on the list, yet only a handful were referenced, and as another said, one of the organisations on that list had been deleted previously through AfD. The strongest keep therefore was WP:STAND, but that was struck as a result of misinterpretation. This is the full reason for my close. However, deleting admins don't generally say any more than """"keep"""" or """"delete"""" in their closing statement, unless 1) there is a specific reason for the delete and/or 2) it was a decision that could cause controversy.

It reduced customary exports to Italy, Spain, Japan, Chile, and Peru, selling nearly all of its exportable corn and grain sorghum surplus to the Soviet Union. In return, it received prices of almost 25 cents over the American selling price from the desparate Soviet foreign trade organization responsible for grain imports, Export Khleb. In addition, Export Khleb wooed Argentina into an agreement to sell 20 million tons of corn and grain sorghum, and 2.5 million tons of soybeans to the Soviets over the next five years.

I am aware of wikipedia policy and don't need to reread it. I broke policy knowingly. I apologize for doing so. It was for the sake of whimsy. That impulse has left me, and I make the promise that it will not return. I do not retract anything that I said. The bigger issue which I have been addressing is the flaw within the system itself. After repeated requests to actually read what I'm saying here and what I actually said on the Beat Generation page, you clearly have mistunderstood me. Your claim that you have ignored evidence in the prosecution of my punishment is one among many disturbing signs of the flaws within the Wikipedia system. What you call extraneous issues are indeed central issues. You have done little to convince me otherwise. For example, the sockpuppetry was a bad idea when considering rules of civility, and I won't let it happen again. It was a good idea in that it was funny, but like I said, that's out of my system. The bigger issue  a central issue, not extraneous  is that admins claimed I was being dishonest. This is evidence of laziness and lack of real concern for the real job you are meant to do. If the real problem is that I was uncivil, then I apologize and make an honest promise that I will never do it again. I don't believe that really is a central issue. I'm not blaming anyone else for me being uncivil; I chose to do it and have never claimed otherwise. The problem is Wikipedia is a toilet. Why is it a toilet? Wikipedia is a punchline. Why is it a punchline? Because people who passionately care about truth get angry (even if it was pretend) on occassion? No. I realize uncivil behavior can be a contributing factor in that it can fail to lead to a positive change; I was practically begging for a positive change on the Beat Generation page, and nothing was happening. Certain other editors were relying on Wikipedia rules to stymie progress. Block me or don't block me, I don't care (and judging from the history of this process and my history with Tao  I fear you'll scan this for trigger words, see """"I don't care"""" and say, """"If you don't care, why are you wasting my time?"""" totally missing the point of what I'm actually saying)  but please look in the mirror and think about the real problem here. If you skip the first part where I genuinely apologize for the actual infraction and said I would never do it again (just as I genuinely apologized for the infraction last time and said I would never do it again  and I can keep saying this over and over again) and if you once again just look at this part and claim I'm focusing on extraneous issues and incorrectly claim that I'm blaming others  blaming others for my rant? no, please actually see: my rant is my responsibility, and once again I apologize for it  whatever you do, despite my lack of faith in anyone's ability to genuinely take some time and think about these things, please just consider what's right and what's wrong here on a larger level while in the short term focusing on my genuine heart-felt apology.

Templating The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time
Thanks for soliciting my opinion. There seems to be little support for adding awards and such to infoboxes:
Infobox Musical artist
And templates for awards of the """"magazine's top ten list"""" type tend to be deleted:
Down Beat Jazz Hall of Fame inductees
I don't have a strong opinion in the matter, but it seems the general preference is to not have awards templated at all, but rather mentioned in the article body text where appropriate, and omitted when such mention gives undue weight to the award. If a template like this is to gain acceptance, it needs to be less intrusive. Putting the 500 Greatest list in the article infobox is the most intrusive possible placement, suggesting that Rolling Stone's perspective on a record is as essential an element as the release date—even I consider that undue weight.

If you still want to try this, my suggestion would be a collapsible box placed much lower in the article, the way  is placed at the bottom of Miles Davis. However, it might be a good idea to seek feedback on Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Songs before putting much work into this. /  ☺ ☭ 17:00, 1 May""",0

 Werner's Transformation 

Thanks for the feedback.

The section titled The era of the est training (1971 - 1984) says: He [Werner] started to see the world as perfect """"the way it is"""" and reported an insight that his attempts to change or modify either his physical circumstances or his mental outlook had their basis in a conception of the world (that it should differ from """"the way it is"""") that precluded or at least limited one's experiential and creative appreciation of it.

This attempts to describe a pivotal evet in Werner's life that he referrs to as a transformation. I felt that the description above fell way short of what it was that Werner has said he experienced. I'm not sure what the source of this material is. Describing an experience like this is exceedingly difficult. Seeing the world as perfect actually, I believe, was only a part of Werner's experience of transformation. Here is how Werner described it in his own words in the film Transformation: The Life and Legacy of Werner Erhard.

The way est happened was very simple. I had this transformational experience. I had a transformation. Whoever I had been up until that point I no longer was. I was on my way to work and there was nothing significant about it but I was on the Golden Gate Bridge. I just happened to be there and that's when I had the realization that what my life was about was really meaningless. It was empty. And this realization that the things that I thought were so significant like looking good and winning, just the normal things that most people think are important, that they really had no importance, that it was all empty and meaningless. When I broke through the sadness, broke through the sense of despair of having wasted my life, I all of a sudden realized """"My God, I'm free."""" What's that mean to be free: free to choose, free to create a life that was worth living.

In order to describe it accurately why not quote Werner directly? I did my best to capture his words exactly as he spoke them. Is that considered a reliable source, given that it's a record of him speaking personally?

My purpose in posting this was to improve this section first for accuracy and second to elaborate in an event that was pivotal in his life.""",0

Second, I do not agree that capitalism is an economic system; there are many scholars who argue that it is not an economic system, and an NPOV description of capitalism can't make an assertion that represents one point of view.  Third, there are non-capitalist societies where the means of production are privately owned, and some scholars argue that capitalism threatens the private ownership of capital, so again this definition is inaccurate or at best violates NPOV policy.  Fourth, it is just poorly written, the second and third clauses are redundant.  Fifth, it leaves out what many consider the defining feature of capitalism, which is the commoditization of labor.

Hi Rob, my guess would be editors who sympathize with the British position.  Collins is something of a hero to the British and the Protestant right wingers in Ireland (and are remnants of the former Protestant ruling class) since he signed the treaty to end the Irish War of Independence that created the Irish Free State.  Sinn Fein and the IRA, the left wingers and Catholic, were against it and viewed Collins as a traitor.  The Civil War resulted.  The IRA assassinated him.  The treaty allowed the British to still subjugate the Irish.  Lloyd George and Winston Churchill were ecstatic.  Eamon de Valera and Sinn Fein were not.  They wanted a Republic and to be rid of the British entirely.  The British and the Irish Protestants are still big Collins' fans.  Downplaying his Catholicism, in fact virtually eliminating the religious aspects of the conflict, is something the British do.  It's PR.  Malke2010 """,0

Does any one moniter you Phil? First you add, then you delete, then you re-add the same information, then you delete each time citing a different reason.

Your latest removal of reference to Heart Beat Records as copyright owner stated the reason you removed it was because it was being contested in court. This was after you took it off and then came back and added it.

Regardless, the reason you cite for your actions THIS time is inaccurate. The copyright owner , Hearbeat Records, has sued another party for violating copyrights that they own. There are no suits against them or legal proceedings where someone has contested their ownership. Where do you get this from? Please cite your source as the only public information availabe is the law suit in which Heart Beat has sued another party for violating copyrights they own in as verified by the US Copyright office.

I simply do not understand how you come up with your reasoning to not cite Heart Beat as the official copyright holder of the CD's that are listed under the US Copyright Office?
